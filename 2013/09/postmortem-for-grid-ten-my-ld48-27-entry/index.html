            </header>
            <p>For the 27th <a href="http://ludumdare.com">Ludum Dare</a> 48-hour game making com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tion, I created an
entry called <em>Grid Ten</em>. It was my 6th entry into the com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tion, and needed
to be based around the theme '10 Seconds'. The com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tion voting isn't quite
over at the time of this writing, but here are my thoughts on how my game turned
out.</p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p><strong>Pre- theme an&shy;nouce&shy;ment:</strong> I had planed to use <a href="http://inform7.com">Inform 7</a> or <a href="http://www.gimcrackd.com/etc/src/">Twine</a> for
creating a text adventure, but I had also considered <a href="http://haxe.org/">Haxe</a> with <a href="http://haxeflixel.com/">HaxeFlixel</a>
or <a href="http://haxepunk.com/">HaxePunk</a> as a fall-back if I didn't want to do a text adventure. Other
than that, I went into the com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tion with no sub&shy;stan&shy;tial ideas for the direction
I wanted to go.</p>
<p><strong>Theme An&shy;nounce&shy;ment:</strong> The IRC chat room was full of hate for '10 Seconds', and
I just knew this was the theme going to be picked. So, when it was announced,
I was already thinking about what I could do. Initially I started drafting some
sort of story that would revolve around using '10 seconds' in the context of a
lat/long coordinate. I actually spent a good 4 hours working on this concept
before going to bed for the night.</p>
<p><strong>The next morning:</strong> With the an&shy;nounce&shy;ment happening only 4 or so hours before
I went to bed, it gave my sub&shy;con&shy;cious a good chance to mull over what I had worked
on the night before. When I woke up, I started having doubts about my ideas from
the night before -- none of them were really 'gelling' with me. So after about
2 hours, I came upon the core idea for what turned into <em>Grid Ten</em>, which was
definitely not a text-adventure.</p>
<p><strong>The rest of the first day:</strong> After getting the core concept for <em>Grid Ten</em>
fleshed out a bit more, I decided to forgo Haxe, etc, and just work directly
with html/css/javascript. It's a toolset I'm really familiar with, and my
concept would work very well with pro&shy;gram&shy;mat&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly generated textures that I
thought would be easier to do with the canvas element than with HaxeFlixel or
HaxePunk. I also decided I didn't want a compile step in my de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment, nor
did I want to deal with flash. The majority of the work went really smooth,
I was really able to focus in on just the minimum code necessary -- I actually
had some code to implement tails for the enemies, but then I quickly saw that
that code would just bloat the game un&shy;nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;i&shy;ly. It got cut out pretty quick,
I didn't just comment it out, I completely removed it. I didn't want anything
that would distract my focus. At the end of the day, I had the mechanics that
I was shooting for pretty well fleshed out. There was still a LOT to add to the
game, but the very core was in place!</p>
<p><strong>Day 2:</strong> I spent a good 7 hours polishing everything up -- I added some
primitive animations, another 'block' the player could place, I also did some
op&shy;ti&shy;miza&shy;tions and improved the 'in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gence' of the enemies and added a menu,
and a end-game screen. Generally, I polished the thing up quit a bit. I did
stop early, around 3pm, to start the process of packaging and releasing. I'll
talk about this a bit more later, but I should have definitely kept at it for
at least another 2 or 3 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Post- com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tion end:</strong> I ended up fixing a bug whereby user placed blocks
would stick around after a reset. Small, and easily fixed, but I should have
totally caught that before submission!</p>
<h3>The GOOD</h3>
<ul>
<li>I leveraged a platform that I know fairly well</li>
<li>I stuck really well to a plan for absolute minimum viable product -- I didn't
    put a lot of extra cruft into the game that I didn't think sig&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cant&shy;ly
    improved the experience. Take, for example, the start and end screens -- I
    put a large 'bouncing' text on both screens which didn't add anything to
    game-play, but it made the start and end screens much less boring to look
    at, which is important for first im&shy;pres&shy;sions I think.</li>
<li>I got plenty of sleep and food (always important!)</li>
</ul>
<h3>The BAD</h3>
<p>There are really only three things I think were really bad this time around:</p>
<ul>
<li>I basically scratched and restarted what I was doing after about 6 hours
    total of de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment time. This hurt -- but, to be fair, I wasn't 'feeling'
    the text-adventure I started with, and it was probably good for my sanity
    to restart with the game I did.</li>
<li>I quit 2 or 3 hours earlier than I really should have, and in that time I
    probably could have done quite a lot of polishing.</li>
<li>I used mostly original code -- I used zero game related engines/frameworks</li>
</ul>
<h3>The UGLY</h3>
<p>Overall I'm really happy with the project, and I think the core concept has a
lot of potential. I see a few ways that it could grow and change, and I'm
actually pretty excited to continue working on this game in my down time.</p>
<p>However, I think I'll probably end up re-writing most of it. The style I used
to code the game isn't sus&shy;tain&shy;able I think... growing the project much larger
would hurt, especially adding some of the mechanics into it that I have ideas
for. I don't know that I'll have to write every piece of code from scratch, but
good chunks of it for sure.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I think I've gotten some fairly positive comments on my <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-27/?action=preview&amp;uid=7263">entry page</a>,
and I got around a 2.5 out of 5, which is about where I was expecting this time
around. If there were more mechanics and more polish, then I think I would have
absolutely nailed it.</p>
<p>Next time!</p>
