        <title><![CDATA[Completely Useless HTTP Server in Rust]]></title>
        <link>http://joelkleier.com/blog/2015-01-completely-useless-httpd-in-rust-lang</link>
        <summary><![CDATA[<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/01/09/Rust-1.0-alpha.html">Rust 1.0 Alpha</a> just
released, and I think it&#8217;s about time to dig into it. I have an idea for a
very personal side project (just a handy tool for me and my wife to use), and
a super simple HTTP (read: basically useless) server fits the bill for one of
the requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s be clear: by 'super simple' I really mean a server that understands
the absolute bare minimum of HTTP to serve a response in the most stupid/simple
of ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Turns out, if you ignore almost all HTTP features, it&#8217;s really quite simple
(I think&#8230;&#8203; I&#8217;ll probably eat my words later ;)!
In the rest of this post I&#8217;ll throw some Rust code at you, basically
ripped out of the example in the <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/">std::io
documentation</a>, then walk through my process in learning exactly what the
heck is going on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Code:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust">use std::io::{TcpListener, TcpStream};
use std::io::{Acceptor, Listener};
use std::thread::Thread;

fn handle_client(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    stream.write_str("HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\nahoy!");
}

fn main() {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:8080");
    let mut acceptor = listener.listen();

    for stream in acceptor.incoming() {
        match stream {
            Err(e) =&gt; {
                println!("connection failed");
            },
            Ok(stream) =&gt; {
                Thread::spawn(move|| {
                    handle_client(stream)
                });
            },
        }
    }

    drop(acceptor);
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perusing over this code, my eye catches on the <code>match</code> statement first. Boiled
down, it looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust">match stream {
    Err(e) =&gt; {},
    Ok(Stream) =&gt; {},
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My first thought is that this is just a different kind of <code>select</code> or <code>case</code>
statement&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;but it turns out that it is <em>so much more</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s actually a pattern matching statement that can be used as an <em>expression</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s break that down some:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, "can be used as an expression"&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a <code>match</code> can actually return a value!
This is perfectly legal:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust">let s = match x {
    1 =&gt; "true",
    _ =&gt; "false",
};</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And this actually goes deeper than just the <code>match</code> statement&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;almost everything
in rust is an <em>expression</em>. If an <em>expression</em> is followed by a semicolon, then
the value of the <em>expression</em> is suppressed and it&#8217;s treated like a <code>nil</code> value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An implication of this is that if the last line of a block is not terminated
with a semicolon, it becomes the blocks <em>value</em>. IE:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust">fn test() -&gt; String {
    "test".to_string()
}

println!("{}", test());</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s some more interesting stuff! The <code>.to_string()</code> is necessary in this
example because <code>"test"</code> by itself is of type <code>&amp;str</code> (a reference to a statically
allocated string), which is not the type that the <code>println!</code> macro expects
(macro&#8217;s are indicated by the exclamation). The <code>.to_string()</code> method actually
converts the <code>&amp;str</code> value into a <code>String</code> (dynamically allocated mutable utf-8
string value).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nifty!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Back to the <code>match</code> statement&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;moving past expressions and statements and
back to "pattern matching". The <code>Err(e)</code> and <code>Ok</code> are actually <code>enum</code> values
ultimately of the type <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html"><code>std::result::Result</code></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enums are <em>powerful</em> in Rust in that they let you structure data, then destructure
that data in expressions like <code>match</code>. So, a method can return a value of an
enum type <code>Result</code> and <em>know</em> exhaustively the possible enum values are <code>Ok</code>
or <code>Err</code>. That by itself would be good-to-know information, but practically useless
in many situations&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;there&#8217;s no other information like an error message or
success code, etc. These enums actually allow for sort of 'embedding' values
into them, so the value or values of an enum can be carried with the enum value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the <code>match</code> statement the value held by the <code>Err</code> enum value can be
pulled out (by destructuring the enum values), like so:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust">match resultvalue {
    Ok(resultvalue) =&gt; { /* do something with the resultvalue */ }
    Err(errmsg) =&gt; { println!("error detected: {}", errmsg); }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s enough for this time around. Next time will be more learning
Rust, as well as getting into the nitty-gritty of what is actually needed to
make a minimally useful HTTP server!</p>

<p>Developing hobby games I usually just stick to libraries that already handle
things like <em>physics</em>. Basically I follow examples, copy/paste code, and plugin
numbers. This is good for getting a hobby game <em>built</em> but not so good to learn the
math and gain an intuition of what&#8217;s actually going on, which is what I want
to do now. <a href="http://joelkleier.com/blog/2014-11-physics/">part 0</a>

<strong>part 3</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are only a couple of operations that I&#8217;ve read about that seem generally
useful to my purpose: reflection of a vector about an arbitrary axis, and reversing
the direction of a vector!</p>

<p>This article was written as I attempt to learn the subject matter at hand,
so there is a strong possibility of incorrect information based on my own ignorance.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_reflection_about_an_arbitrary_axis">Reflection About an Arbitrary Axis</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Say you have a vector V and a vector T&#8230;&#8203; how do you reflect vector V about vector T?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The key here is that the intent is not to rotate around just the x and y <em>axis</em>,
no, the rotation should occur about an <em>arbitrary</em> axis! Not as straight forward,
and, like rotation, the math is a little much for me to delve into right now,
but <a href="http://planetmath.org/derivationof2dreflectionmatrix">here&#8217;s a great resource</a>,
which provides the following formula:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>w' = w - 2(w . v)v</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the V and T values defined earlier, this turns into:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>V' = V - 2(V . T)T</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(the period is supposed to represent the <code>dot product</code> operation)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the code ends up looking like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">vector.nim</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-nimrod" data-lang="nimrod">proc reflect*(self, axis: Vector): Vector =
    var V = axis * (self.dot(axis) * 2)
    return self - V</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Admittedly, this is untested at the time of this writing, but that <em>should</em> be
the gist of the operation as code.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_reversing_the_direction_of_a_vector">Reversing the Direction of A Vector</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is almost too simple! If you think about it, to reverse a vector is simply
to subtract it&#8217;s x and y distances instead of add them, so reversing a vector
really just boils down to returning the opposite of each of it&#8217;s components,
like so:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">vector.nim</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-nimrod" data-lang="nimrod">proc reverse*(self: Vector): Vector =
    result.x = -self.x
    result.y = -self.y</code></pre>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, my grasp of <em>some</em> of the math requried for 2D game physics is
a little less shaky, and has already helped me out! The next step
is to dive in to some more advanced concepts, like the Separating-Axis
Theorem for detection and (possibly) resolution of collisions. But, I&#8217;m not
sure if I&#8217;ll continue into that subject next week or not. There are some other
languages, tools, and libraries that I&#8217;d like to take a deeper look into.</p>

<li>
<p>My wife was absolutely amazing&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it is <strong>very</strong> important to have the support of
those you love and respect when every part of you is tired and your mind is
practically putty. Every word of encouragment helps renew commitement
to the process of seeing the 48-hours through.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tooling&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;I made a concious effort to look back at my previous entries and
use only tooling that I felt I did good work with. To that end, I used
<a href="https://love2d.org">LÖVE</a>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a framework that you script with Lua. Not my
favorite language, but the community is solid, the documentation is good,
and the tools are easy to dive into.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Twitter turned out to be a very motivating tool&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;<em>#LDJAM</em> was trending so
every tweet got quite a bit of attention, this was really the first time
I&#8217;ve interacted with complete strangers so actively. Normally I just lurk
in social environments, but this was definitely a positive experience and
it makes me curious how much more useful it could be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.gifgrabber.com/">GifGrabber</a> and <a href="https://imageoptim.com/">ImageOptim</a>
are two fantastic tools for generating short little progress "videos"&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and
the "videos" were a motivation all in themselves. After taking a series of
these throughout my game, it let me reflect on my progress much more
visually that a static screenshot (or nothing at all) would. This is
surprisingly powerful, epsecially when you are working on something that is
very dynamic and visual by nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I stayed hydrated and didn&#8217;t starve myself&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;seemingly irrelevant maybe,
but this is an important one. Learned that lesson <em>long</em> ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My recent (incomplete) dive into 2d game physics <em>really</em> helped out. Not
a particuarly impressive example, but I was quite proud of myself when I
finished the code to dynamically create polygonal circles, then deform them
in such a manner to make them appear to be odd-shaped asteroids! It was a
moment that I would have normally gone hunting for examples online. This time
I thought through the entire problem, and already <em>knew</em> how to solve it.
Such a small thing, but so very motivating.</p>

to maintain sanity in stressful situations, but 3 hours seems to be more
than I needed.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t didn&#8217;t <em>stop</em> when I was getting tired on the second night&#8230;&#8203; which

<p>If economy of time is important, don&#8217;t explore unfamiliar tools, and if you

<h2 id="_rotation">Rotation</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The simple case is to consider what happens when you rotate a unit vector in
90 degree increments. Specifically, let&#8217;s consider the vector [1, 0]. The
sequence of values will be: <em>[1, 0], [0, 1], [-1, 0], [0, -1]</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From this, a pattern emerges:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>x' = -y
y' = x</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This breaks down for any other increment than 90, but that&#8217;s because 90 is
a special case for a more generalized formula (where <code>t</code> is an angle):</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>x' = cos(t)*x - sin(t)*y
y' = sin(t)*x + cos(t)*y</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is more often represented in <em>matrix</em> form (called a <em>rotation matrix</em>):</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>R(t) = |cos(t) -sin(t)|
       |sin(t)  cos(t)|</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But when it&#8217;s multiplied by a vector <code>[x, y]</code> you&#8217;ll get the first formula. Even
with all of the reading and exploration that I&#8217;ve done, I don&#8217;t think I fully
<em>grok</em> this enough to really explain it without regurgitating text book information
that doesn&#8217;t really explain everything. My current understanding is that the
formula is basically deriving an <code>x</code>/<code>y</code> offset caused by the first angle, then
figuring out the second angle in <code>x</code>/<code>y</code>, then applying the offset.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yay! Time for some code, which is a lot more concise that the above :)</p>

    result.y = s*self.x + cs*self.y

# a special case, slightly faster than the general formula

<p>Developing hobby games I usually just stick to libraries that already handle
things like <em>physics</em>. Basically I follow examples, copy/paste code, and plugin
numbers. This is good for getting a hobby game <em>built</em> but not so good to learn the
math and gain an intuition of what&#8217;s actually going on, which is what I want
to do now. <a href="http://joelkleier.com/blog/2014-11-physics/">part 0</a>

<p><em>Vectors</em> are the basic building block of 2D game physics. They describe the
distance and direction of game objects (from player characters to projectiles,
even lighting). As such, I think they may be the <em>best</em> place to start this
exploration and self-learning exercise.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-vectors">What are Vectors?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Vectors represent two measurements&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a magnitude and a direction. For example,
"traveling at 2 kph (kilometers per hour) due east" is a vector! This data is
descriptive, but not necessarily useful for computation in that format.  To
make the data more useful, it is typically encoded into two numerical values,
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, representing a distance from the origin on the x and y axis.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our "traveling at 2 kph due east" example then turns into something like <code>[2, 0]</code>,
which would look something like:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><canvas data-processing-sources="/static/processingjs/2d-game-physics--vectors/vectors.pde /static/processingjs/2d-game-physics--vectors/example1.pde"></canvas></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The important thing to remember is in order to think about a (2D) vector
in concrete numbers, we can express it as a pair of these x and y values.
IE (0, 1), (30.3, 2.2), etc. These 2 numbers represent
a <em>distance</em> on the x and y axis, and not a point&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;this is important
because it means vectors are encoded as the <em>legs</em> of a <em>right triangle</em>. Why
is this important? I&#8217;ve found that it helps me to <em>visualize</em> vectors in a 2D
space.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In terms of (Nim) code, this could be expressed as a 2 dimensional array, a tuple,
or more explicitly, like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">vector.nim</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-nimrod" data-lang="nimrod">type
  Vector* = object
    x*: float
    y*: float</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I like the more explicit approach in this case because I think it&#8217;ll make
writing dependent code a little more clear, and I need as much clarity I can
get.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first really useful value to calculate based off of this vector encoding is
the <em>magnitude</em>. This turns out to be pretty simple. Remember how the this vector
encoding is basically showing us the lengths of the legs of a <em>right triangle</em>?
Taking advantage of that, we can use Pythagoras Theorem, which boils down to
this formula: <em>x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = h<sup>2</sup></em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>magnitude</em>, then, is the <em>h</em> value, and since the formula is for <em>h<sup>2</sup></em>,
rearranging it to solve for <em>h</em> turns it into: <em>sqrt(x<sup>2</sup> + y^2) = h</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think the results of both formulas will be useful later, so I&#8217;m going to make
two procedures&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;one to calculate the magnitude squared (<em>h<sup>2</sup></em>) and the
magnitude itself (just <em>h</em>), here&#8217;s the code:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">vector.nim</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-nimrod" data-lang="nimrod"># magSq == "magnitude squared" == h*h
proc magnitudeSq*(self: Vector): float =
  result = self.x * self.x + self.y * self.y

# the actual magnitude value (h)
proc magnitude*(self: Vector): float =
  result = sqrt(self.magSq)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
the <code>sqrt</code> comes from the Nim standard library <code>math</code>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The definition of a vector is a <em>magnitude</em> AND <em>direction, so how do we encode
the direction in terms of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>? Simple put, the _sign</em> of the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
values indicates their direction. If the <code>x</code> is <em>positive</em> then the vector is going an
<em>easterly</em> direction (if we&#8217;re thinking of <em>direction</em> in terms of the cardinal
directions) and a <em>positive</em> <code>y</code> would be a <em>northernly</em> direction. A <em>negative</em>
<code>x</code> value will be in a <em>westerly</em> direction, and a <em>negative</em> <code>y</code> value would
be in a <em>southernly</em> direction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In terms of code, there&#8217;s nothing extra needed since <code>Vector.x</code> and <code>Vector.y</code> are
signed values.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="adding-subtracting">Adding and Subtracting Vectors</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, why add and subtract vectors? The best answer is an example: presuming a characters
movement is described by velocity (direction and speed, encoded as a vector) and
acceleration (change in direction and speed, encoded as a vector), then it is
only natural that when it comes time for a character to move within the simulation,
their <em>acceleration</em> should be added to their <em>velocity</em>, and the result should
be added to their current position. Being able to add <em>acceleration</em> and <em>velocity</em>
(both vectors) becomes super important here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Adding and subtracting vectors, conceptually, is like traveling along the the
hypotenuse of one triangle, then traveling along the hypotenuse of a second
triangle. From where the first vector began to where the second vector ends is
the resulting vector. Confusing?
<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors_and_spaces/vectors/v/adding-vectors">Khan Academy</a>
has a pretty good video on adding vectors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s my attempt to visualize it:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first vector:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><canvas data-processing-sources="/static/processingjs/2d-game-physics--vectors/vectors.pde /static/processingjs/2d-game-physics--vectors/example2.pde"></canvas></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second vector:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><canvas data-processing-sources="/static/processingjs/2d-game-physics--vectors/vectors.pde /static/processingjs/2d-game-physics--vectors/example3.pde"></canvas></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Traveling along the first vector, then traveling along the second vector to get a third vector:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><canvas data-processing-sources="/static/processingjs/2d-game-physics--vectors/vectors.pde /static/processingjs/2d-game-physics--vectors/example4.pde"></canvas></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The resulting vector:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><canvas data-processing-sources="/static/processingjs/2d-game-physics--vectors/vectors.pde /static/processingjs/2d-game-physics--vectors/example5.pde"></canvas></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The math for this is straight forward: add the two <code>x</code> values for the result <code>x</code> value,
add the two <code>y</code> values for the result <code>y</code> value. The same formula can be used for
subtracting vectors as well, just subract the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values instead of adding them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The resulting code might look like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">vector.nim</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-nimrod" data-lang="nimrod"># just overload the `+` operator
proc `+`*(a, b: Vector): Vector =
  result.x = a.x + b.x
  result.y = a.y + b.y

# just overload the `-` operator
proc `-`*(a, b: Vector): Vector =
  result.x = a.x - b.x
  result.y = a.y - b.y</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="scaling">Scaling Vectors</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <em>scalar</em> is just a single number, and <em>scaling</em> a vector by a <em>scalar</em> is the
act of multiplying the <em>vector</em> by the <em>scalar</em>. Why is this useful? Let&#8217;s say
there&#8217;s a scenario where a ball rolls along a floor&#8230;&#8203; how fast does it slow
down? This could be modeled by using a <em>scalar</em> value for friction, and shrinking
the <em>velocity</em> (a vector) of the ball by that much every tick of the simulation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The math for scaling a vector is as simple as multiplying the <em>scalar</em> by the
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> components of the vector. In terms of code, it might look something
like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">vector.nim</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-nimrod" data-lang="nimrod"># just overloaded the `*` operator
proc `*`*(a: Vector, b: float): Vector =
  result.x = a.x * b;
  result.y = a.y * b;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="unit-normalized">Unit Vectors and Normalized Vectors</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <em>unit vector</em> is a vector who&#8217;s length/magnitude is exactly 1. A <em>normalized
vector</em> is a vector who&#8217;s components have been divided by it&#8217;s magnitude in order
to be in proportion with a unit vector. For example, the vector <code>[1, 2]</code> has a
magnitude of about <code>2.236</code>. If this vector is <em>normalized</em>, it&#8217;s value would
become <code>[1/2.236, 2/2.236]</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why is this useful? The key is that a normalized vector is <em>proportional</em> to
the original vector. This means the <em>normalized</em> vector carries direction with
a proportional encoding for magnitude, thus enabling the <em>normalized</em> vector to
be scaled to any size proportional to the original magnitude.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, why is this useful? I think it&#8217;s best illustrated with an example! Think
of light reflecting off of several objects. Each object has a vector describing
an amount of light that get&#8217;s reflected, as well as a direction of reflection.
The intensity of light can be represented by a single scalar value, turning the
problem into one of <em>scaling</em> each objects light vector.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If each object&#8217;s light vector is <em>normalized</em>, then they will have a consistent
representation of reflected light based on the same <em>scale</em>. If each light vector
were <strong>not</strong> <em>normalized</em>, then there would be a very inconsistent representation
of light, each object behaving like it existed in it&#8217;s own little world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whew. I hope that helped. Here&#8217;s some code to implement normalization:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">vector.nim</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-nimrod" data-lang="nimrod">proc normalize*(self: Vector): Vector =
  result.x = self.x/self.mag;
  result.y = self.y/self.mag;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="dot-product">The Dot Product</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Seriously, <a href="http://blog.wolfire.com/2009/07/linear-algebra-for-game-developers-part-2/">Wolfire&#8217;s Linear Algebra for Game Developers, Part 2</a>
has a great example of the <em>dot product</em> and why it&#8217;s useful. Not even going
to try to make a better example and explanation, because I doubt I could at this point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ll paraphrase though, the <em>dot product</em> is kind of a proportion of how much
the vectors are pointing in the same direction. It&#8217;s also kind of useful in
<a href="#projection">Projecting a Vector onto Another</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suffice it to say, here&#8217;s some code for implementing the dot product:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">vector.nim</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-nimrod" data-lang="nimrod">proc dot*(A, B: Vector): float =
  return A.x*B.x + A.y*B.y;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice that this code looks an aweful lot like the <em>magnitudeSq</em> method! Intuitively,
then, the dot product of vector A against intself would be the <em>h<sup>2</sup></em> value
when solving for Pythagora&#8217;s Theorem&#8230;&#8203; which means our magnitude code could
be adjusted to look more like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">vector.nim</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-nimrod" data-lang="nimrod"># just get the square-root of the dot product of the vector against itself
proc magnitude*(self: Vector): float =
  result = sqrt(self.dot(self))</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="projection">Projecting a Vector onto Another</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The act of <em>projecting</em> a vector onto another is, essentially, finding the vector
between the <em>points</em> <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> in the following image:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><canvas data-processing-sources="/static/processingjs/2d-game-physics--vectors/vectors.pde /static/processingjs/2d-game-physics--vectors/example6.pde"></canvas></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Intuitively, if the vector being projected onto is a <em>normalized</em> vector, then
really the problem becomes straight forward! First, find the <em>magnitude</em> of the
vector resulting from a vector projected onto a <em>normalized</em> vector (turns out,
this is the <em>dot product</em>). Then, scale the <em>normalized</em> vector (who&#8217;s legs are
proportional to each other) by the <em>magnitude</em> to get the resulting vector
encoded as <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why is this useful? This is kinda hard for me to answer in what I feel is total
understanding, as I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve actually <em>used</em> it enough to really grasp
it use. The text book answer might be a few things:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>finding the proportion of how much of one vector lies in another&#8217;s
direction (useful for determining if AI with a view arc can see a player,
for example)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tying into the first point, finding the angle between two vectors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>finding the local coordinates of a vector on an arbitrary axis other than
the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> axis</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s still a pretty meaty explaination. I guess it boils down to being able
to see a vector in the context of another, and making assumptions based off the
result.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that I will be using <em>projection</em> pretty heavily once I start
getting into implementing the <a href="http://www.codezealot.org/archives/55">Separating Axis Theorem</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enough talk! Let&#8217;s see some code:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">vector.nim</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-nimrod" data-lang="nimrod"># this procedure handles a more generalized form of projection (IE when unit

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="conclusion">Vectors - Conclusion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I <em>think</em> I&#8217;ve gone through all of the absolute basics of vectors as they
immediately relate to 2D game physics. The next
step for me to take will be to (re)learn about linear transformations (for
things like vector rotation, reflection, etc). I&#8217;m fairly certain there are
shortcuts for these things, especially for 2D, but the goal is to develop an
intuition about this stuff, so it&#8217;s important that I don&#8217;t just copy/paste
code or take every formula at face value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next time will <em>probably</em> be a much shorter post, specifically covering
my re-learning useful linear transformations for 2D
vectors and hopefully dealing with a lot more code!</p>

<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Matt Cutts in his TED Talk "Try something new for 30 days"
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Those words really resonated with me when I watched
<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days">Matt Cutt&#8217;s TED Talk</a>,
and launched into the idea of writing a blog post once per day for 30 days.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I latched onto writing on my blog because for <em>years</em> it&#8217;s been a very inconsistent,
on/off activity&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;one that had close to the lowest priority in my life. Inverting
the priority of this activity has forced me to really consider the how and
why&#8217;s of keeping a blog.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What I&#8217;ve discovered:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>I can&#8217;t post something unless I give it an hour or more of my attention (the
quality of the writing goes way down with less time, to the point where I
am writing what essentially amounts to a long-form tweet or a facebook/g+
type of post)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of the posts I&#8217;m particuarly happy with were written either early in
the morning before work or before dinner time (the longer I put it off, the
more likely I was to fall into the trap of posting filler for filler&#8217;s sake)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing down questions about, and snippets of, code that I don&#8217;t understand
<em>really</em> helped me focus and gain a deeper understanding than I would have
if I just <em>looked</em> at it&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;subsequently, I feel like these were some of my
best posts in terms of content (if not in quality of writing)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filler for filler&#8217;s sake makes nobody happy&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The result of this challenge has really made me think about how I want to write,
how often I want to write, and what I feel like I&#8217;m good(ish) at writing. The
conclusion I&#8217;ve come too is that I don&#8217;t what to write a <em>post</em> every day. I just
end up with lots of filler that clutters up my blog and makes it look a little
more trashy and irrelevant.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve considered how to proceed, and I think I still want to write and work on
a post or article every day, but only publish once per week. There are times
when I think I&#8217;ll probably post more&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;I post everything to the main blog, and
then have a 'brewlog' which is a tagged subset of posts about brewing&#8230;&#8203; those
posts, and similiar posts, will probably still be published irreguarly. I won&#8217;t
be considering those posts my weekly article.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The subject matter I&#8217;ve enjoyed most this past month has definitely been the
<em>Nim!</em> posts&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;writing was a great way to focus and clarify the process of
learning Nim. In the future, I&#8217;d like to continue to apply this technique to
learning more than just new computer languages.</p>

<p>In short:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>I&#8217;m going to post a regular article once per week.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s next? <a href="http://joelkleier.com/blog/2014-11-physics/">Yesterday</a> I posted
about wanting to brush off some dust on my math skills and really learn how to
do proper physical simulation in (2D) games. Specifically, I&#8217;m considering writing
about developing a Nim library or framework for simple 2D physics&#8230;&#8203; purely as
an exercise to develop my understanding of the math required in such a case.</p>

        <summary><![CDATA[<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest: when I&#8217;ve hobby-developed games in my past, I&#8217;ve either used
super simple "physics" or just used an existing framework so as not to get
stuck on implementing any sort of physics simulation. Everytime I move past this
point, though, I&#8217;m left without any real understanding&#8230;&#8203; I plug in the numbers,
retype and copy code, and just hook things up to make them work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This kinda bugs me, so I want to really internalize what it takes to make a
2d physics engine. And by internalize, I mean that I want to brush off some of
the math I studied in high school and college, and really understand how it
applies to physical simulation. In addition, I want to understand how to write
code to do physical simulations&#8230;&#8203; and I don&#8217;t mean just glue code. I want to really
understand what&#8217;s going on behind the scenes, and develop an intuition for it!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why not just stick with the pre-made libraries and frameworks, and leave the physics
stuff up to people who focus a whole lot on physics? It&#8217;s a hobby&#8230;&#8203; and I want
to learn more about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To do this, I&#8217;ve dug around a bit for some online resources:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://blog.wolfire.com/2009/07/linear-algebra-for-game-developers-part-1/">Wolfire&#8217;s <em>Linear Algebra</em> series</a>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;while not called "physics", it covers some of the basic math behind _physic_al simulation
using a little linear algebra.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/vector-maths-a-primer-for-games-programmers/">Wildbunny&#8217;s <em>Vector maths - a primer for games programmers</a>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which covers what it says, basically an overlap of what _Wolfire&#8217;s</em> article is
about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/2011/04/06/physics-engines-for-dummies/">Wildbunny&#8217;s <em>Physics Engines for Dummies</em></a>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;lots of info, but the actual source code costs some cash (which may or may
not be worth it&#8230;&#8203; I wouldn&#8217;t know since I can be a cheapskate when it comes
to this sort of thing, and I&#8217;m probably not going to buy it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/">gafferongames.com&#8217;s <em>Game Physics</em> articles</a>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;some seamingly really good information here, possibly over my head this far
out of maths practice.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="http://www.rodedev.com/tutorials/gamephysics/">Nate Rode&#8217;s <em>2D Game Physics 101</em></a>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;some examples of various maths needed for 2D physics.</p>

the math and code needed for creating a 2d physical simulation engine.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m <em>certain</em> there are a lot more resources out there on the web, and probably
just as many in meat-space!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing I&#8217;m going to do is review some math on
<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra">Khan Academy</a>, then I&#8217;m going to
use Nim to play around with some of these concepts and shake the rust off!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bigmessowires.com/2014/11/17/68-katy-68000-linux-on-a-solderless-breadboard/">This is so awesome</a>.
<a href="http://www.bigmessowires.com/">This guy</a> put together a 68000-based computer,
running linux, on a <em>solderless</em> breadboard. 1MB of address space, 512K 8-bit SRAM,
512K Flash ROM (480K addressible, 32K memory-mapped I/O devices), and runs at 2MHz with
performance closer to a 1MHz 68000 (which is apparently slow&#8230;&#8203; originally the
68000 ran at 8MHz).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I love projects like this. They show at once how simple and how complicated and
amazing computers are.</p>

<p>Woohoo!!! <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/">Ludum Dare 31</a> is almost upon us! I haven&#8217;t
participated since August 2013 because of life stuff, but I&#8217;m hoping that I can
squeeze in enough time this coming December to make <em>something</em>, even if I don&#8217;t
get to spend the whole time on it, and even if it&#8217;s super crappy.</p>
