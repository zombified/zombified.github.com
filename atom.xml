        <link>http://joelkleier.com/blog/2014-11-physics</link>
        <summary><![CDATA[<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest: when I&#8217;ve hobby-developed games in my past, I&#8217;ve either used
super simple "physics" or just used an existing framework so as not to get
stuck on implementing any sort of physics simulation. Everytime I move past this
point, though, I&#8217;m left without any real understanding&#8230;&#8203; I plug in the numbers,
retype and copy code, and just hook things up to make them work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This kinda bugs me, so I want to really internalize what it takes to make a
2d physics engine. And by internalize, I mean that I want to brush off some of
the math I studied in high school and college, and really understand how it
applies to physical simulation. In addition, I want to understand how to write
code to do physical simulations&#8230;&#8203; and I don&#8217;t mean just glue code. I want to really
understand what&#8217;s going on behind the scenes, and develop an intuition for it!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why not just stick with the pre-made libraries and frameworks, and leave the physics
stuff up to people who focus a whole lot on physics? It&#8217;s a hobby&#8230;&#8203; and I want
to learn more about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To do this, I&#8217;ve dug around a bit for some online resources:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://blog.wolfire.com/2009/07/linear-algebra-for-game-developers-part-1/">Wolfire&#8217;s <em>Linear Algebra</em> series</a>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;while not called "physics", it covers some of the basic math behind _physic_al simulation
using a little linear algebra.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/vector-maths-a-primer-for-games-programmers/">Wildbunny&#8217;s <em>Vector maths - a primer for games programmers</a>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which covers what it says, basically an overlap of what _Wolfire&#8217;s</em> article is
about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/2011/04/06/physics-engines-for-dummies/">Wildbunny&#8217;s <em>Physics Engines for Dummies</em></a>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;lots of info, but the actual source code costs some cash (which may or may
not be worth it&#8230;&#8203; I wouldn&#8217;t know since I can be a cheapskate when it comes
to this sort of thing, and I&#8217;m probably not going to buy it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/">gafferongames.com&#8217;s <em>Game Physics</em> articles</a>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;some seamingly really good information here, possibly over my head this far
out of maths practice.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="http://www.rodedev.com/tutorials/gamephysics/">Nate Rode&#8217;s <em>2D Game Physics 101</em></a>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;some examples of various maths needed for 2D physics.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m <em>certain</em> there are a lot more resources out there on the web, and probably
just as many in meat-space!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing I&#8217;m going to do is review some math on
<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra">Khan Academy</a>, then I&#8217;m going to
use Nim to play around with some of these concepts and shake the rust off!</p>

        <title><![CDATA[Nim! pt9 - Pointer Fun]]></title>
        <link>http://joelkleier.com/blog/2014-11-nim-pt9</link>
        <summary><![CDATA[<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my <a href="http://joelkleier.com/blog/2014-11-nim-pt8">last post</a> on Nim, I talked
about how I was learning to use generics. This time, I&#8217;d like to talk a bit
about pointers!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>first</em> thing to know is that there are two different types of pointer&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the "safe" and "unsafe" kind. The "safe" one is <em>traced</em> (in Nim parlance) and
managed by a garbage collector. The <em>untraced</em> ("unsafe") pointers are expected
to be entirely managed by the user&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;these are very useful for accessing hardware,
or interoping with non-Nim code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>seocnd</em> thing to know is that you really don&#8217;t need them unless you are, in
fact, interoping with <em>C</em> code, accessing hardware, or have a very specific
use-case. Of course I didn&#8217;t <em>know</em> that until after writing a few hundred lines
of code and then writing up the first draft of this article&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my search for some questions I came up with in the first draft, I came across
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22096880/what-is-the-model-of-value-vs-reference-in-nimrod"><em>this</em></a>,
which explained the folly of my ways (well, not directly, but I was able to
think through the problems I was solving with a better understanding).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But, <em>awesome</em>! Now I have a much better grasp on when and when <em>not</em> to use
Nim&#8217;s pointer constructs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s the equivalent of some code I was trying to write (note: this is the
<em>bad example</em> of how to use pointers&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;not that this example <em>won&#8217;t work</em>,
it&#8217;s just not a place you need to use pointers):</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>type
  TBaz = object
    y: int
  PBaz = ref TBaz
  TFoo = object
    baz: TBaz
  PFoo = ref TFoo

proc init_new(foo: var PFoo; y: int) =
  foo = PFoo()
  new(foo.baz)
  foo.baz.y = y

proc baz_accessor(f:var PFoo): var PBaz =
  return f.baz
proc `baz_accessor=`(f:var PFoo, baz: PBaz) =
  f.baz.y = baz.y
  discard """and I was doing some other stuff here (which is why I had the 'baz_accessor' property at all"""

var bar: PFoo
PFoo.init_new 1
assert(bar.baz_accessor.y == 1)
assert(bar.baz.y == 1)
bar.baz_accessor = 10
assert(bar.baz_accessor.y == 10)
assert(bar.baz.y == 10)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And here&#8217;s some code whose end result is the same, without pointers (and without
the "old" syntax, which I also found out about from the aboved linked article&#8230;&#8203;):</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>type
  Baz = object
    y: int
  Foo = object
    baz: Baz

proc baz_accessor(f:var Foo): var Baz =
  result = f.baz
proc `baz_accessor=`(f:var Foo, y: int) =
  f.baz.y = y
  discard """and I was doing some other stuff here (which is why I had the 'baz_accessor' property at all"""

var bar = Foo(baz: Baz(y:1))
assert(bar.baz_accessor.y == 1)
assert(bar.baz.y == 1)
bar.baz_accessor = 10
assert(bar.baz_accessor.y == 10)
assert(bar.baz.y == 10)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first example (the one that uses pointers) uses 26 lines and 581 characters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second example (the seemingly <em>correct</em> one) uses 18 lines and 445 characters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not a huge difference for this particular example, but as code grows I have first
hand knowledge that it becomes a bigger difference! The second, <em>correct</em> example
is clearly more concise and readable. It also has no actual need for the <code>init_new</code>
method, like the pointer approach really does need. Certainly if initialization
was a more important aspect of the <code>Foo</code> type, then the <code>init_new</code> method would
have stayed in the second example.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On-wards and upwards! I have some code to clean up now&#8230;&#8203; but this whole
process has been enlightening.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>2014-11-19 Addendum:</em> After posting this article, I received a nice message from
<a href="http://gradha.github.io/index.html">this guy</a> regarding a couple of things:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>When there is a need for an init function for an object, the convention for
much of the existing code has been something like <code>init_Somthing_</code>, but a newer
convention is to just use <code>init</code> and let the compiler auto-select the correct
<code>init</code> method based on the arguments passed to it. The
<a href="http://nimrod-lang.org/sets.html#init,TSet">A</a>,int[<em>sets</em> library] is a good
example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other is on the <a href="http://gradha.github.io/articles/2014/10/adding-objectivec-properties-to-nimrod-objects-with-macros.html">subject of getters/setters</a>.
The article describes how to utilize Nim&#8217;s awesome <a href="http://nimrod-lang.org/manual.html#macros">macro</a>
system to automatically generate properties with specific actions for particuarly
styled members of types. Lots of good information there about macros and AST&#8217;s!</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a proliferation of people streaming their coding&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;I&#8217;ve seen it the most
when I follow and participate in the <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/">Ludum Dare</a> or
with the likes of <a href="http://notch.net/">notch</a>. I get that people may want to know
the 'secret sauce' of a particular developer&#8230;&#8203; but isn&#8217;t it <em>boring</em> to watch
someone write text? Isn&#8217;t it akin to watching someone handwrite or type a novel?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To me that sounds about as much fun as watching grass grow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I mean, I see real value in a discussion between the streamer and the viewer in
a more lecture-like session, and I see the value in recording a session for
voice overs or footage for teaching programming later&#8230;&#8203; but why would anyone
want to just tune into a stream like that?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s different for someone just starting to get into programming. Or maybe
it&#8217;s less that people are tuning into actively watch, but more of a background
thing that they can interact with occasionally?</p>

        <title><![CDATA[Nim! pt8 - Generics]]></title>
        <link>http://joelkleier.com/blog/2014-11-nim-pt8</link>
        <summary><![CDATA[<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my <a href="http://joelkleier.com/blog/2014-11-nim-pt7">last post</a> on Nim, I tried to
figure out the answer to "How do I test in Nim?". The answer was, basically,
create a separate program with a bunch of asserts for each module I want to test.
The next thing I decided I should learn about are how Nim implements Generics!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s look at a little snippet of a vector library I&#8217;m developing in Nim:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>type
  TVec2*[T] = object
    x*: T
    y*: T

# pretty print the vector
proc `$`*[T](a:TVec2[T]): string =
  result = "(" &amp; $a.x &amp; "," &amp; $a.y &amp; ")"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This code actually illustrates <em>several</em> concepts! First, lets talk about
<em>operator overloading</em>. You overload operators by naming a procedure specially,
IE with back-ticks around the operator symbol. There are a couple of operators
that don&#8217;t have overloading implemented (like the assignment operator, <code>=</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above example demonstrates an operator used to automatically convert a type
into a string, very useful when dealing with an unknown generic type.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The brackets and <code>T</code> value (<code>[T]</code>) after <code>TVec2*</code> tells the compiler that when
being instantiated, a type <code>T</code> should be specified for <code>TVec2</code>. The <code><strong></code> means
that the <code>Tvec2</code> type should be <em>exported</em> for use outside the module. The <code>T</code>
value can be used anywhere in the subsequent expression (Ex: <code>y</strong>: T</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This means that the above definition of <code>TVec2</code> needs to be instantiated something
like so:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>var vec = TVec2[float](x: 1, y: 1)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note the <code>[float]</code> after <code>TVec2</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This turns out to be pretty straight forward and scaleable to more than one type
being defined generically.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that the brackets <em>always</em> come <em>after</em> the export
symbol (<code>*</code>), if there is one.</p>
</div>]]></summary>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff">_why</a> was active and fairly
well known, especially in the Ruby community (from what I gather). The person
behind _why, whatever his reasons, decided to abruptly end his work as _why in
2009.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had heard about _why in passing&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;probably in 2009 when everyone who knew
about him and didn&#8217;t understand his motives was all a-chatter about him. But I
hadn&#8217;t really read any of his work. This changed when I stumbled across
<a href="http://perl11.org/potion/">Potion</a>, and read the
<a href="http://perl11.org/potion/pamphlet.html">pamphlet</a> written, apparently,
by _why himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I came away from reading that a little impressed by the writing&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;conversational, humble, funny, clear, concise, and easy to read. I don&#8217;t think
<em>Potion</em> itself is anything but an esoteric language for doing hobbiest-level
projects at this point, but the <em>writing</em> is really good. You should check it out!</p>
