            <p>The 24th <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com" title="Ludum Dare">Ludum Dare</a> has come and gone, and now it's time for me to take a look back

<h5>What Went Right</h5>
<ul>
<li>I used tech I was, at the least, familiar with:<ul>
<li>Sublime Text 2</li>
<li>LOVE</li>
<li>bfxr</li>
<li>Audacity</li>
<li>au&shy;to&shy;track&shy;er-bu.py</li>
<li>Schism Tracker</li>
<li>GIMP</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prepa&shy;ra&shy;tion!</li>
<li>I spent the time up front to get solid gameplay up and running</li>
<li>I slept and ate normally</li>
<li>No personal-life cat&shy;a&shy;stro&shy;phe's!</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this was my best LD48 game yet. I ended up picking and sticking with a tech stack that I knew --
granted, I don't know every piece all that <em>well</em>, but I was familiar with everything. I had used it
all before, and was very com&shy;fort&shy;able with all the doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion there is.</p>
<p>Even though I was familiar with the stack, I still prepared by building small programs focusing on
certain aspects I was less familiar with -- like audio. LOVE (because of SDL) has an issue with audio
clips bogging down the game when a lot are played. Eventually the sound cuts out all together. Because
I was making little test programs, I dis&shy;cov&shy;erred this issue and was able to work around it before
I was under the stress of the com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tion. Saved a couple hours of tinkering and reading.</p>
<p>It took me a while to figure out the kind of game I wanted to make, but more on that later. After I
figured out a direction I wanted to go, instead of making a menu and adding in all the overhead right
away, I started im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly on the gameplay. I started just thinking that a game like Osmos would
be cool, but instead of trying to become the biggest on the map, you wanted to survive for the longest.
To do so, you would need to grow and shrink. I figured that just bigger and smaller circles would work
well for this -- you could get bigger by eating smaller circles, and get smaller by bumping larger
circles.</p>
<p>I quickly discovered that it was kinda boring -- there was no real challenge. Once you got big enough,
you'd fill the screen.</p>
<p>This is when I thought of the concept of a circle that <em>always</em> made you shrink, and grew in proportion
to your shrinkage. This introduced an obstacle that the player needs to avoid, which makes the game
a lot more chal&shy;leng&shy;ing.</p>
<p>Once I got all the sizes, speeds, and ran&shy;dom&shy;iza&shy;tion tweaked, I was basically done with the gameplay,
and I felt that all the rest of my time could be spent on making the game look and sound good.</p>
<p>During this whole process I was able to follow my normal routines, which felt great. Less stress from
staying up until 3am and eating like shit.</p>
<h5>What Went Wrong (or, at least, not as good as it could have gone)</h5>
<ul>
<li>Not a whole lot of polish and shine</li>
<li>Rules were maybe a little two abstracted in terms of pre&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion to the user</li>
<li>The game starts a little to hard, or perhaps it was too random</li>
<li>It took me the better part of 5 hours to come up with an idea for a direction that I wanted to go</li>
</ul>
<p>To be honest with myself, I spent an inordinate amount of time creating and tweaking the font, and
I'm happy with it, overall. I con&shy;cen&shy;trat&shy;ed on the font, but then became kind of lax on making textures
for the circles, and coming up with a better game board. Overall, I spent almost no time on polishing
the UI, except for the fonts.</p>
<p>I put each of the rules in a short quote from a fictional character (the "She" in "And Thus She Spake"),
but I suspect they ended up getting ignored, as most people just typed a name and jumped in to play. I
thought they were clever (maybe the low-side of clever, but at least a <em>little</em> clever), but in
retrospect, they were just to abstract for the audience. And to be honest, I think I could have maybe
drawn in the reader a little more by forcing the player to read the text first in an intro sequence.</p>
<p>But, easier might be to just be more straight forward with the rules. I dunno though, on the one
hand I think the ab&shy;strac&shy;tion of the rules makes it fun to figure out, on the otherhand, they weren't
really useful.</p>
<p>Everything in the game is random, but it's randomized all at once, and in one lump group. There are
no stages and there is no prog&shy;gres&shy;sion. There could still be ran&shy;dom&shy;iza&shy;tion with stages/pro&shy;gres&shy;sion,
and I think it would have help players learn how to play a lot faster. Not sure if it would have
helped much though. I feel like it would have given the game a different flavor -- right now I think
it's a fast game you can pickup and get into really quick once you figure things out. There are no
levels, there's no pro&shy;gres&shy;sion, except your score. You, as a player, never need to feel like you
need to get anywhere in the game to have fun. The player has the same experience at the start of the
game as the end of the game.</p>
<p>Perhaps a bigger barrier to entry, but a lot less cruft for ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;enced players.</p>
<p>The worst part of the com&shy;pen&shy;ti&shy;tion was coming up with a concept for "Evo&shy;lu&shy;tion". I had lots of
ideas, but, honestly, I'm not intimately familiar with genetic al&shy;go&shy;rithims and AI, so everything
I thought of would be made x10 harder since I would have needed to spend a lot of time reading and
bug fixing.</p>
<h5>What can I do to get better?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Next time, I think I will push myself a little harder to spend more time on polish. If I'm honest,
    I did have around 6-8 hours that I could have used to do more polish. My only excuse is that
    I needed to do some errands.</li>
<li>To reduce the 5 hours it took to even think of a topic, I think maybe I should have a sketchbook
    ready in front of me ready to use. Perhaps not stop thumb&shy;nail&shy;ing and drawing until the creative
    side of my brain figures something else.</li>
<li>Perhaps even work on the gameplay a little longer.</li>
<li>Have some basic things already lined up in libraries -- like code for menu UI and such.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than that, I think to get better, I just need to make more games :D</p>
