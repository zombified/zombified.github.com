<h5>[20:00 August 24th]</h5>
<p>Evolution.</p>
<p>Let's see what I can do!</p>
<h5>[23:38 August 24th]</h5>
<p>Well, after a few hours of racking my brain, possibly a short nap, and some down time with the missus, I have an idea. Not a very com&shy;pli&shy;cat&shy;ed or original one, but one that I think has some potential.</p>
<p>Here's a first look at it:</p>
<p><img alt="FLOW, Screen Shot at 23:38 on 24 August 2012" src="/pics/LD48_24_FLOW_201208242338.png" title="FLOW"/></p>
<p>Not much to see, and not much to do in it, but it's a start!</p>
<p>Time for bed.</p>
<h5>[6:45 August 25th]</h5>
<p>Rested, and ready to go!</p>
<p>My goal for today is to have the entirety of gameplay done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat small blobs, grow bigger</li>
<li>Get hit by bigger blobs, grow smaller</li>
<li>Start overlay</li>
<li>Dead/End overlay</li>
<li>Pause overlay</li>
<li>Sounds</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal for tomorrow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix up the UI</li>
<li>Add some animations</li>
<li>Fancy shit up</li>
<li>Add bonus and penalty blobs</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm certain that my plans will change, but here goes nothing!</p>
<h5>[7:30 August 25th]</h5>
<p>Refactored some of my code a little, and added in some basic collision detection.</p>
<p><img alt="FLOW, Screen Shot at 7:28 on 25 August 2012" src="/pics/LD48_24_FLOW_20120825728.png" title="Basic Collision Detection"/></p>
<p>Now it's time for a shower and breakfast. Let's start this day off right!</p>
<h5>[11:46 August 25th]</h5>
<p>The game mechanics are shaping up nicely! I think there's a little more tweaking I want to do before I start on the menu's and sounds, but it's (IMO) quite enjoyable for a quick 5 minutes of play.</p>
<p><img alt="FLOW, Screen Shot at 11:48 on 25 August 2012" src="/pics/LD48_24_FLOW_201208251148.png" title="You must survive!"/></p>
<h5>[14:04 August 25th]</h5>
<p>I've got the start and end screens func&shy;tion&shy;ing the way I want them, and I've pretty much stopped tweaking the mechanic. I think it is good enough the more I play it. There's lots of things that I could add in to it... like a blob that would keep you the same size, an ability to push or pull all the blobs aound the mouse and such.</p>
<p>I've also come to think that the game is an analogy for life, so I'm rolling with it.</p>
<p>I do need to come up with a better name than 'FLOW' though, as it's just my working title.</p>
<p>Here's the death screen:</p>
<p><img alt="FLOW, Screen Shot at 14:03 on 25 August 2012" src="/pics/LD48_24_FLOW_201208251403.png" title="Shit, you're dead."/></p>
<h5>[18:13 August 25th]</h5>
<p>Quick update before I eat dinner. I was going kinda slow this afternoon, but the "high scores" are displaying and the player can ether their name.</p>
<p>I'm going to work on a easter egg next... :)</p>
<p><img alt="FLOW, Screen Shot at 18:12 on 25 August 2012" src="/pics/LD48_24_FLOW_201208251812.png" title="The start screen"/></p>
<h5>[21:58 August 25th]</h5>
<p>Added the easter egg! Not going to say what it is or post a screenshot of it, of course!</p>
<p>Also added music. I am by no means a music guy, so it shouldn't surprise you that it's nothing fancy. Might add a little more tomorrow before I submit the game, but, honestly, I don't know.</p>
<p>Since I spent most of my time on sound stuff, don't really have a screen shot!</p>
<p>Next, I have a little intro text to put on the start screen, then we have to rename the project to something official like.</p>
<h5>[0:28 August 26th]</h5>
<p>Still going strong, decided to create a custom fixed-width font for more alignment!</p>
<p><img alt="FLOW, Screen Shot at 0:27 on 26 August 2012" src="/pics/LD48_24_FLOW_201208260027.png" title="A New Font"/></p>
<h5>[9:33 August 26th]</h5>
<p>Woke up refreshed, had some eggs, and started digging into more polish!</p>
<p>I added a death sound, made the text a little more readable, added an in&shy;struc&shy;tion on how to quit the game (which is probably error prone -- not really sure how to detect OSs/Window Managers well, so the arrow and message may be on the wrong side of the screen for releases like Kubuntu), and changed the title! It is now called "And Thus She Spake".</p>
<p>Here's a screen shot, you can see some of the updated text and the new title:</p>
<p><img alt="And Thus She Spake, Screen Shot at 9:32 on 26 August 2012" src="/pics/LD48_24_ANDTHUSSHESPAKE_201208260932.png" title="And Thus She Spake"/></p>
<h5>[12:53 August 26th]</h5>
<p>Well, with around 7 hours to go I've finished bundling and releasing to the extent that I'm going to do.</p>
<p>Here's a link to the entry (just the preview, not the voting page): <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&amp;uid=7263">And Thus She Spake</a></p>
<p>Here's my releases:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/48144436/LD48/24/And%20Thus%20She%20Spake.love">LÖVE File</a> (Make sure to install [LÖVE] separatly)</li>
<li><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/48144436/LD48/24/AndThusSheSpake-osx.zip">OS/X</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/48144436/LD48/24/AndThusSheSpake-win-x86.zip">Win 32-bit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/48144436/LD48/24/AndThusSheSpake-win-x64.zip">Win 64-bit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Linux users will have to install LÖVE separately and run the <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/48144436/LD48/24/And%20Thus%20She%20Spake.love">LÖVE File</a> as I am not familiar with bundling on those platforms, and there aren't any straight forward directions to follow to bundle for LÖVE.</p>
<p>And one last screenshot:</p>
<p><img alt="And Thus She Spake, Screen Shot at 12:20 on 26 August 2012" src="/pics/LD48_24_ANDTHUSSHESPAKE_201208261220.png" title="And Thus She Spake, Final Screen-Shot"/></p>
