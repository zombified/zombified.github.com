        <p>It's been 8 weeks of waiting patiently to bottle some homebrewed booze!</p>
<p>I've bottle some <a href="/posts/2012/09/eggnog.html" title="0x0001 - Recipe for Eggnog">eggnog</a> and some hard cider (I didn't post the recipe for this yet, I'll get to that though!).</p>
<p>The <a href="/posts/2012/09/eggnog.html" title="0x0001 - Recipe for Eggnog">eggnog</a> has been dubbed <strong>Dirty Snowman</strong> under the label <strong>0x01</strong>, check it out:</p>

<p>It definitly smells of whiskey, but drinking it has a different character. It's smooth -- and
I mean there is almost zero harsh biting at the throat. You do feel that warmth flow from your
throat to your stomach though :)</p>
<p>It's really meant as a base for eggnog -- get some heavy whipping cream and egg whites all
frothed and foamed up, then fold those (separately) into a bowl of the eggnog. Wasn't really
able to test that to it's fullest, but I suspect that will go far to tone down the immediate
flavor of the whiskey, brandy, and rum.</p>
<p>My cider has been dubbed "Delta 88" under the label "0x02", check it out:</p>

<p>It's a very dry cider. Definitely could use some more aging. BUT combined with a little apple juice for sweetness
and flavor, it turns out to be really tasty!</p>
<p>It has an ABV of aproximately 7.8%. I added some alt-sweetener as a back-sweetener, but stupid me... I did it
on ALL of my bottles. I could smack myself. I think it was an okay amount, but... it
might be to much and I can't experiment any more, or see how an unsweetened bottle might taste. Might have botched
my first cider at the last moment! Ah well, we'll see. Live and learn, right?</p>
