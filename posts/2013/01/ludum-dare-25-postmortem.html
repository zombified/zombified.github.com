        <p>Well, voting is over for the <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo" title="Ludum Dare 48-hour Competition">25th Ludum Dare 48-hour competition</a> and my game <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&amp;uid=7263" title="'Apathy' Ludum Dare Entry">"Apathy"</a> came in
a solidly in the middle of the pack.</p>
<p>No ratings under 2.3, and I even had 1 rating over 3! Definitely better than my previous entries.</p>
<p>The selected theme this time around was "You are the enemy."</p>
<p>I used <a href="http://haxe.org">Haxe</a>/<a href="http://haxenme.org">NME</a> + <a href="http://haxepunk.com">HaxePunk</a> to write a Flash game. If you're interested, the <a href="https://github.com/zombified/ld48-25" title="'Apathy' source code hosted on Github">source</a> is
hosted on github.</p>
<h2>What went wrong?</h2>
<ol>
<li>The subject matter of my game came to life for me. I was definitely struggling with some depressive
     and apathetic feelings. Never a good place to be. This sucked up a lot of my time and energy, which,
     I think, led to a stunted experience.</li>
<li>What the win condition represented was, perhaps, a little to abstract or vague for many of the players to
     understand. The player was a manifestation of apathy -- if the player moved around and tried to "play",
     they would be engaged, and not apathetic. Since the player is a manifestation of apathy, though, this
     means the player is losing. The win condition was not to care, and to simply not play. After a time,
     apathy wins out because the player didn't care.</li>
<li>Not enough shiny.</li>
<li>Sound and music could have been improved.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What went right?</h2>
<ol>
<li>I came up with a pretty simple concept fairly quickly</li>
<li>I used some pretty spiffy libs that I had some prior experience with</li>
<li>Good sleep + good food + good communication with the people in my life</li>
</ol>
<h2>What can I do better?</h2>
<ol>
<li>I need to learn how to make some music, or find a better source for music. The tool I'm using (autotracker-bu)
     is starting to sound the same and get a little old. It's output also doesn't really fit with the
     concept of some of the games I want to make. However, I do have to say it is an awesome little utility
     none-the-less.</li>
<li>On a personal level, I need to develop some mental tools to help push through the feeling of apathy
     myself. It can be a tough enemy.</li>
</ol>
