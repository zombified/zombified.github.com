        <div class="paragraph">
<p>Mobile devices are quickly taking over the world. We communicate to each other
in all sorts of ways that once were limited to desktop computers and audio-only
point-to-point connections. We broadcast, share, and hold conversations&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;between
just two people up to thousands, or millions of people. Maybe more. We are living
in an era where <em>anyone</em> (with an internet connection) can potentially
communicate to the <em>entire</em> human population, all at once, for, basically, free.
From a device we carry in our pockets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And I am <em>very</em> happy with all the big players in mobile, pushing this sort of
tech to heights that are truley amazing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get more out of it, though, we need truly free and open alternatives so that
these devices can push boundaries in ways the current options cannot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is where <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/"><em>FirefoxOS</em></a> and
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/phone"><em>Ubuntu Phone</em></a> come into play. These operating systems
may never be "bigger" than Android or iOS in terms of market penetration, but
what they represent, and what they allow people to do is none-the-less important.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FirefoxOS is pushing into low-end markets and trying to make a phone that can
get people onto a web-enabled platform in the same price range as their classic
phones. It&#8217;s very open, and promotes an open culture&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;more than that, it promotes
a <em>web</em> culture. At the same time, it&#8217;s pushing technical boundaries for browsers
by implementing and helping to standardize API&#8217;s for accessing all sorts of native
device features.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ubuntu Phone, on the other hand, is trying to bring a fully open source OS into
the mobile marketplace, but doesn&#8217;t seem to be focusing on the low-end market or
the web, like FirefoxOS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead, Canonical seems to view the mobile space as having the same problems as
the desktop space&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;no good, free libre open source operating systems with completely
open development processes. AND they see a future where mobile devices start
converging into desktop-level computers&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;having a different UI&#8217;s depending on
how they&#8217;re being used. IE a touch based UI for mobile use, and a desktop UI for
when it&#8217;s docked and paired to monitors, keyboards, and mice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea of this convergence may not be Canonicals highest priority with the
failure of the Edge in 2013, but idea is still there. I can&#8217;t wait until it
becomes reality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It may not happen right away, it probably won&#8217;t replace desktops and
laptops completely, it may not be very good when it first starts to really happen, and,
heck, it may fail once or twice. But it will happen. The concept of carrying around
a fully functional computer in our pockets already exists&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the next step
is to make that computer <em>more</em> connectable and <em>more</em> useable for creative
tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The future is awesome, and I think FirefoxOS and Ubuntu will play a huge role
in the future, whether or not they have large marketshare.</p>
