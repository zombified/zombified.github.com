<p>Developing hobby games I usually just stick to libraries that already handle
things like <em>physics</em>. Basically I follow examples, copy/paste code, and plugin

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Vectors represent two measurements&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a magnitude and a direction. For example,
"traveling at 2 kph (kilometers per hour) due east" is a vector! This data is
descriptive, but not necessarily useful for computation in that format.  To
make the data more useful, it is typically encoded into two numerical values,
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, representing a distance from the origin on the x and y axis.</p>

<p>Our "traveling at 2 kph due east" example then turns into something like <code>[2, 0]</code>,

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The important thing to remember is in order to think about a (2D) vector
in concrete numbers, we can express it as a pair of these x and y values.
IE (0, 1), (30.3, 2.2), etc. These 2 numbers represent
a <em>distance</em> on the x and y axis, and not a point&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;this is important
because it means vectors are encoded as the <em>legs</em> of a <em>right triangle</em>. Why
is this important? I&#8217;ve found that it helps me to <em>visualize</em> vectors in a 2D
space.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In terms of (Nim) code, this could be expressed as a 2 dimensional array, a tuple,
or more explicitly, like:</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">vector.nim</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-nimrod" data-lang="nimrod">type
  Vector* = object
    x*: float
    y*: float</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I like the more explicit approach in this case because I think it&#8217;ll make
writing dependent code a little more clear, and I need as much clarity I can
get.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first really useful value to calculate based off of this vector encoding is
the <em>magnitude</em>. This turns out to be pretty simple. Remember how the this vector
encoding is basically showing us the lengths of the legs of a <em>right triangle</em>?
Taking advantage of that, we can use Pythagoras Theorem, which boils down to
this formula: <em>x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = h<sup>2</sup></em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>magnitude</em>, then, is the <em>h</em> value, and since the formula is for <em>h<sup>2</sup></em>,
rearranging it to solve for <em>h</em> turns it into: <em>sqrt(x<sup>2</sup> + y^2) = h</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think the results of both formulas will be useful later, so I&#8217;m going to make
two procedures&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;one to calculate the magnitude squared (<em>h<sup>2</sup></em>) and the
magnitude itself (just <em>h</em>), here&#8217;s the code:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">vector.nim</div>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-nimrod" data-lang="nimrod"># magSq == "magnitude squared" == h*h
proc magnitudeSq*(self: Vector): float =
  result = self.x * self.x + self.y * self.y

# the actual magnitude value (h)
proc magnitude*(self: Vector): float =
  result = sqrt(self.magSq)</code></pre>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The definition of a vector is a <em>magnitude</em> AND <em>direction, so how do we encode
the direction in terms of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>? Simple put, the _sign</em> of the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
values indicates their direction. If the <code>x</code> is <em>positive</em> then the vector is going an
<em>easterly</em> direction (if we&#8217;re thinking of <em>direction</em> in terms of the cardinal
directions) and a <em>positive</em> <code>y</code> would be a <em>northernly</em> direction. A <em>negative</em>
<code>x</code> value will be in a <em>westerly</em> direction, and a <em>negative</em> <code>y</code> value would
be in a <em>southernly</em> direction.</p>

<h2 id="adding-subtracting">Adding and Subtracting Vectors</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, why add and subtract vectors? The best answer is an example: presuming a characters
movement is described by velocity (direction and speed, encoded as a vector) and
acceleration (change in direction and speed, encoded as a vector), then it is
only natural that when it comes time for a character to move within the simulation,
their <em>acceleration</em> should be added to their <em>velocity</em>, and the result should
be added to their current position. Being able to add <em>acceleration</em> and <em>velocity</em>
(both vectors) becomes super important here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Adding and subtracting vectors, conceptually, is like traveling along the the
hypotenuse of one triangle, then traveling along the hypotenuse of a second
triangle. From where the first vector began to where the second vector ends is
the resulting vector. Confusing?
<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors_and_spaces/vectors/v/adding-vectors">Khan Academy</a>
has a pretty good video on adding vectors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s my attempt to visualize it:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first vector:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The math for this is straight forward: add the two <code>x</code> values for the result <code>x</code> value,
add the two <code>y</code> values for the result <code>y</code> value. The same formula can be used for
subtracting vectors as well, just subract the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values instead of adding them.</p>

<h2 id="scaling">Scaling Vectors</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <em>scalar</em> is just a single number, and <em>scaling</em> a vector by a <em>scalar</em> is the
act of multiplying the <em>vector</em> by the <em>scalar</em>. Why is this useful? Let&#8217;s say
there&#8217;s a scenario where a ball rolls along a floor&#8230;&#8203; how fast does it slow
down? This could be modeled by using a <em>scalar</em> value for friction, and shrinking
the <em>velocity</em> (a vector) of the ball by that much every tick of the simulation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The math for scaling a vector is as simple as multiplying the <em>scalar</em> by the
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> components of the vector. In terms of code, it might look something
like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">vector.nim</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-nimrod" data-lang="nimrod"># just overloaded the `*` operator
proc `*`*(a: Vector, b: float): Vector =
  result.x = a.x * b;
  result.y = a.y * b;</code></pre>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="unit-normalized">Unit Vectors and Normalized Vectors</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <em>unit vector</em> is a vector who&#8217;s length/magnitude is exactly 1. A <em>normalized
vector</em> is a vector who&#8217;s components have been divided by it&#8217;s magnitude in order
to be in proportion with a unit vector. For example, the vector <code>[1, 2]</code> has a
magnitude of about <code>2.236</code>. If this vector is <em>normalized</em>, it&#8217;s value would
become <code>[1/2.236, 2/2.236]</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why is this useful? The key is that a normalized vector is <em>proportional</em> to
the original vector. This means the <em>normalized</em> vector carries direction with
a proportional encoding for magnitude, thus enabling the <em>normalized</em> vector to
be scaled to any size proportional to the original magnitude.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, why is this useful? I think it&#8217;s best illustrated with an example! Think
of light reflecting off of several objects. Each object has a vector describing
an amount of light that get&#8217;s reflected, as well as a direction of reflection.
The intensity of light can be represented by a single scalar value, turning the
problem into one of <em>scaling</em> each objects light vector.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If each object&#8217;s light vector is <em>normalized</em>, then they will have a consistent
representation of reflected light based on the same <em>scale</em>. If each light vector
were <strong>not</strong> <em>normalized</em>, then there would be a very inconsistent representation
of light, each object behaving like it existed in it&#8217;s own little world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whew. I hope that helped. Here&#8217;s some code to implement normalization:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">vector.nim</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-nimrod" data-lang="nimrod">proc normalize*(self: Vector): Vector =
  result.x = self.x/self.mag;
  result.y = self.y/self.mag;</code></pre>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="dot-product">The Dot Product</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Seriously, <a href="http://blog.wolfire.com/2009/07/linear-algebra-for-game-developers-part-2/">Wolfire&#8217;s Linear Algebra for Game Developers, Part 2</a>
has a great example of the <em>dot product</em> and why it&#8217;s useful. Not even going
to try to make a better example and explanation, because I doubt I could at this point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ll paraphrase though, the <em>dot product</em> is kind of a proportion of how much
the vectors are pointing in the same direction. It&#8217;s also kind of useful in
<a href="#projection">Projecting a Vector onto Another</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suffice it to say, here&#8217;s some code for implementing the dot product:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">vector.nim</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-nimrod" data-lang="nimrod">proc dot*(A, B: Vector): float =
  return A.x*B.x + A.y*B.y;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice that this code looks an aweful lot like the <em>magnitudeSq</em> method! Intuitively,
then, the dot product of vector A against intself would be the <em>h<sup>2</sup></em> value
when solving for Pythagora&#8217;s Theorem&#8230;&#8203; which means our magnitude code could
be adjusted to look more like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">vector.nim</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-nimrod" data-lang="nimrod"># just get the square-root of the dot product of the vector against itself

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="projection">Projecting a Vector onto Another</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">

<p>The act of <em>projecting</em> a vector onto another is, essentially, finding the vector

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Intuitively, if the vector being projected onto is a <em>normalized</em> vector, then
really the problem becomes straight forward! First, find the <em>magnitude</em> of the
vector resulting from a vector projected onto a <em>normalized</em> vector (turns out,
this is the <em>dot product</em>). Then, scale the <em>normalized</em> vector (who&#8217;s legs are
proportional to each other) by the <em>magnitude</em> to get the resulting vector
encoded as <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why is this useful? This is kinda hard for me to answer in what I feel is total
understanding, as I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve actually <em>used</em> it enough to really grasp
it use. The text book answer might be a few things:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>finding the proportion of how much of one vector lies in another&#8217;s
direction (useful for determining if AI with a view arc can see a player,
for example)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tying into the first point, finding the angle between two vectors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>finding the local coordinates of a vector on an arbitrary axis other than
the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> axis</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s still a pretty meaty explaination. I guess it boils down to being able
to see a vector in the context of another, and making assumptions based off the
result.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that I will be using <em>projection</em> pretty heavily once I start

<p>I <em>think</em> I&#8217;ve gone through all of the absolute basics of vectors as they
immediately relate to 2D game physics. The next
step for me to take will be to (re)learn about linear transformations (for
things like vector rotation, reflection, etc). I&#8217;m fairly certain there are
shortcuts for these things, especially for 2D, but the goal is to develop an
intuition about this stuff, so it&#8217;s important that I don&#8217;t just copy/paste
code or take every formula at face value.</p>
