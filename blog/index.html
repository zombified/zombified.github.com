    <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Last December I <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&amp;uid=7263">participated</a> in the <a href="http://ludumdare.com">Ludum Dare</a> (#22), and ultimately used <a href="http://www.melonjs.org">melonJS</a> as my framework of choice.</p>
<p>The next Ludum Dare is coming up, and this time it's the 10th anniversary of the competition!</p>
<p>I need to be prepared.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have decided to do a short series, for my benefit, on how to make a melonJS game.</p>
<p>The game I will be developing is going to be called <em>Minefield</em>, and is based off of the <em>Doger</em> game from <a href="http://inventwithpython.com/chapter20.html">Invent With Python</a>.</p>
<p>The full source code will be found on <a href="http://github.com">github</a> under my <a href="https://github.com/zombified/minefield">minefield</a> project. Specifically, the code in this post can be found at <a href="https://github.com/zombified/minefield/tree/a6b40e8ec2d495d6589ccfc9166d2e65649647ac">this commit</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>All required files to make this app work are stored in the repository. The <code>libs</code> directory contains all libraries used that aren't specifically created for this project.</p>
<p>There are only 2 significant files (outside of melonJS) in the repo so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>index.html</li>
<li>js/PlayScreen.js</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/zombified/minefield/blob/a6b40e8ec2d495d6589ccfc9166d2e65649647ac/index.html">index.html</a></h2>
<p>This is where most of the magic happens for the base structure needed for the game.</p>
<p>Check out the source, the code is fairly small, and all the important sections have comments.</p>
<p>The one line that I'd like to make a note about is:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id="app"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>It provides a location for melonJS to create it's render surface. The ID is arbitrary, and is used in the call to <code>me.video.init</code>.</p>
<h2>PlayScreen.js</h2>
<p>For now, this is just an empty object. We will be using this object to build up our PLAY state later on.</p>

  <p>I Decided to sit down and design a new theme, which is still rough and in development. </p>
<p>I also decided it was time to move my website over to github. This is for a couple of reasons... so I don't have all my eggs in one basket (Google), and so I don't have to do as much maintenance.</p>
<p>Basically the appengine tools are tools that I only use for updating my website/blog. Why not replace those tools with a single tool that I use for other stuff to?</p>
<p>Now I just need to use git, which I don't have to manually update and setup since it's in my OS's package repositories! Woohoo, less work for me!</p>

    <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Check out one of my old college projects I recently dug up: <a href="https://github.com/zombified/bobcompiler">the bob compiler</a>.</p>
<p>My first real big Python program made over the span of a semester in 2007, for a compiler course.</p>
<p>It's hardly commented, horribly designed, and poorly coded, but I'm still proud of how much effor I put into this little project. As I recall we were only ever intended to create a single-pass compiler that simply interpreted tokens as it read them, and spit out assembly as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Instead, I chose to make primitive parser, lexer, semantic analyzer, and translator components. Eventually I was planning on adding optimization options, but I never got to it.</p>

  <p>Spent a little time re-arranging my website. Nothing fancy, just a few tweaks. I kind of like it plain text... need to find the time to style it slightly though. The typeface is hurting my eyes a little.</p>
<p>Also updated my twitter username! 'pbdiode'. Figured I'd stick with it since that's what I'm registered at <a href="http://ludumdare.com">ld48</a> with. It's time for a change I think.</p>

    <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>10 Days left until the event!</p>
<p>I will be recording the event -- I'll be using 'recordmydesktop', with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>recordmydesktop --no-sound --on-the-fly-encoding --v_quality 30 --no-frame
</code></pre>
<p>Then I just let it sit! Hopefully I'll have enough disk space... it is set to record at a crappy quality, so I should have enough space. And my tests indicate the text is at least readable... eh. We'll see.</p>
<p>Now on to finding out about audio...</p>
<p>WolframTones seems interesting, but I can't seem to get firefox configured correctly for it. I'm also having issues setting up PulseAudio, so I may have issues recording even a tone matrix output. Ugh.</p>
<p>I think I'm just going to forego the music for now. Less to stress me out, less to actually work on during the competition. I will, at least, have good sound effects from sfxr!</p>
<p>So, what do I need to do next to prepare?</p>
<ul>
<li>I know what tech I'm using -- Javascript/HTML/CSS, melonJS</li>
<li>I'm axing the music generation</li>
<li>I have my tools ready -- a terminal, tmux, vim, chromium and firefox, sfxr, gimp, recordmydesktop, tiled</li>
<li>I've posted an 'I'm In' message on the ludum dare website (http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2011/12/06/im-in-255/) -- I posted under 'pbdiode', supposedly pronounced 'lead diode'. I think it sounded better in my head.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it's time I practice a bit. I think I'll do some exercises to get myself more familiar with melonJS.</p>
