  <p>The last several months have been quite eventful for me, and this poor excuse for a blog has been low on my list of priorities -- but no longer!. Well, maybe it's moved up a notch or two.</p>
<p>I will probably continue my declare 'MelonJS' articles soon, but for now I am on to other things.</p>
<p>First up is my <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&amp;uid=7263">ludum dare #23 entry</a>, a text adventure called 'The Tiny World'. It's not fancy, and it's built from scratch (I know, I know -- I probably should have just gone with inform7). Play it if you like, it's probably mediocre at best!</p>
<p>Second up, my new job is a lot about Python and, more specifically, Plone, so expect to see some posts on those things.</p>

  <p>Last December I <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&amp;uid=7263">participated</a> in the <a href="http://ludumdare.com">Ludum Dare</a> (#22), and ultimately used <a href="http://www.melonjs.org">melonJS</a> as my framework of choice.</p>
<p>The next Ludum Dare is coming up, and this time it's the 10th anniversary of the competition!</p>
<p>I need to be prepared.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have decided to do a short series, for my benefit, on how to make a melonJS game.</p>
<p>The game I will be developing is going to be called <em>Minefield</em>, and is based off of the <em>Doger</em> game from <a href="http://inventwithpython.com/chapter20.html">Invent With Python</a>.</p>
<p>The full source code will be found on <a href="http://github.com">github</a> under my <a href="https://github.com/zombified/minefield">minefield</a> project. Specifically, the code in this post can be found at <a href="https://github.com/zombified/minefield/tree/a6b40e8ec2d495d6589ccfc9166d2e65649647ac">this commit</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>All required files to make this app work are stored in the repository. The <code>libs</code> directory contains all libraries used that aren't specifically created for this project.</p>
<p>There are only 2 significant files (outside of melonJS) in the repo so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>index.html</li>
<li>js/PlayScreen.js</li>
</ol>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/zombified/minefield/blob/a6b40e8ec2d495d6589ccfc9166d2e65649647ac/index.html">index.html</a></h3>
<p>This is where most of the magic happens for the base structure needed for the game.</p>
<p>Check out the source, the code is fairly small, and all the important sections have comments.</p>
<p>The one line that I'd like to make a note about is:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id="app"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>It provides a location for melonJS to create it's render surface. The ID is arbitrary, and is used in the call to "<code>me.video.init</code>".</p>
<h3>PlayScreen.js</h3>
<p>For now, this is just an empty object. We will be using this object to build up our PLAY state later on.</p>

  <p>I Decided to sit down and design a new theme, which is still rough and in development. </p>
<p>I also decided it was time to move my website over to github. This is for a couple of reasons... so I don't have all my eggs in one basket (Google), and so I don't have to do as much maintenance.</p>
<p>Basically the appengine tools are tools that I only use for updating my website/blog. Why not replace those tools with a single tool that I use for other stuff to?</p>
<p>Now I just need to use git, which I don't have to manually update and setup since it's in my OS's package repositories! Woohoo, less work for me!</p>

  <p>Check out one of my old college projects I recently dug up: <a href="https://github.com/zombified/bobcompiler">the bob compiler</a>.</p>
<p>My first real big Python program made over the span of a semester in 2007, for a compiler course.</p>
<p>It's hardly commented, horribly designed, and poorly coded, but I'm still proud of how much effor I put into this little project. As I recall we were only ever intended to create a single-pass compiler that simply interpreted tokens as it read them, and spit out assembly as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Instead, I chose to make primitive parser, lexer, semantic analyzer, and translator components. Eventually I was planning on adding optimization options, but I never got to it.</p>

  <p>Spent a little time re-arranging my website. Nothing fancy, just a few tweaks. I kind of like it plain text... need to find the time to style it slightly though. The typeface is hurting my eyes a little.</p>
<p>Also updated my twitter username! 'pbdiode'. Figured I'd stick with it since that's what I'm registered at <a href="http://ludumdare.com">ld48</a> with. It's time for a change I think.</p>
