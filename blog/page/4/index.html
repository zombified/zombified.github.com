  <p>I've uploaded a semi playable version, <a href="/projects/ping/">play it here</a>!</p>
<p>I'm definitely not done with it, I still have a start screen, pause screen, win/loss screen, better AI, font tweaks, game play tweaks, and a lot of testing to do.</p>
<p>However, I want to move onto "Blocks of Desctruction 2", a break-out like game, which was originally going to be a follow-up to my tetris like game, <a href="/projects/bd/bd.html">Blocks of Destruction</a>.</p>
<p>I started experimenting with various platforms and used Pong as a problem to solve. My intention was never to create a full featured pong game, all I wanted was an easy(ish) problem to solve while tinkering!</p>
<p>Ultimately, I need to stop tinkering and experimenting. So now <a href="/projects/ping/">Ping</a> will be put on hold, perhaps indefinitely, and I will start working on "Blocks of Descruction 2".</p>
<p>I will be posting something each and every day that I work on the game, so, stay tuned imaginary internet people!</p>

  <p>Switching tactics on creating this lovely Pong-like game, I present you with a possible (partial) solution to the audio woes of the Audio spec for "HTML5".</p>
<p>Found at <a href="http://www.storiesinflight.com/html5/audio.html">Stories in Flight</a>, the solution is basically to pre-load your sounds, then to load each sound into a new audio object (channel) every time you want to play a sound. This method rely's on the browser caching the audio to not perform multiple requests for the audio source from the server. It's not perfect, but I think it's more than sufficient for my current needs.</p>

    <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I'm interested in playing around with <a href="http://haxe.org">haXe</a> -- it seems like a concept I could get behind and have some fun with.</p>
<p>In trying to get a working little example that uses webgl/canvas, I've come accross a file called "Html5Dom.hx".</p>
<p>I was curious about the origin of this file, so I did a small amount of looking. The source seems to be from the <a href="https://launchpad.net/jeash">Jeash</a> project, which was created from the merging of the Canvas-NME and Neash projects. However, the Html5Dom.hx file seems to not contain any reference to webgl until changeset 27 (a0f27fc5c734) on August 16th 2010. At this point a port of the Khronos groups <a href="http://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/webgl.idl">WebGL IDL</a> was added to the file. Further changes fixed areas of the initial port by adding support for the TypedArray ID from the Khronos group.</p>
<p>Easy enough information to find out, but is the file relevant (the webgl spec is moving fast, or so I've read), or is there some other work out there to create an extern library for haxe that enables the use of WebGL for the javascript target?</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this is the best, and possibly only, extern library made publicly available for WebGL use in haXe. I found a <a href="http://mikecann.co.uk/programming/5000000-chrome-crawlers-why-not-haxe-webgl/">blog post</a> by a 'Michael Cann' that uses a version of the Html5Dom.hx extern library for a test project that produces 5,000,000 point sprites on screen, so I think the library is still relevant.</p>
<p>I did find the <a href="https://github.com/tong/hx.html5">hx.html5</a> project, but that seems to just contain extern's for the 2D canvas context.</p>
<p>I also found a extern library for <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">three.js</a>, called <a href="https://github.com/jgranick/three.js-completion">three.js-completion</a>. This library doesn't seem to be updated to the latest three.js version though. Might still be a starting point.</p>

    <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>In experimenting with webgl, I've found the webgl-debug.js script (from the khronos group) extremely helpful.</p>
<p>You can find it, and directions for using it, at: <a href="http://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Debugging">www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Debugging</a></p>
<p>You can also find a link to the WebGL Inspector there as well, which seems like it might be a really useful tool, but with my small experiments thus far, I haven't had the chance to make use of it.</p>
<p>I also found this nice little utility from mrdoob: <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js">stats.js</a> -- it provides FPS and Milliseconds-Per-Frame numbers (along with little charts) and can provide a memory size statistic too, but for that you need to pass special parameters into chrome/safari (at least at the time of this writing).</p>

    <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I've been doing a bit of experimentation with languages!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Clojure</em> was interesting, I haven't done much with lisp before, so this was someone of an experience! I definitely enjoyed the absolute simplicity of the syntax and the idea that your code is just data. Fascinating stuff.</li>
<li><em>Scala</em> was different... OO + Functional programming melded together to provide a language with a lot of syntax, but the power to be concise and as fast as any java application.</li>
<li><em>F#</em> -- this one I'm just starting with. It's another OO + Functional language, apparently in the vein of OCaml (which I have zero experience with). So far, I'm rather liking it -- I may even stick with it for long enough to create something substantial with it!</li>
