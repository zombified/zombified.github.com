  <p>In experimenting with webgl, I've found the webgl-debug.js script (from the khronos group) extremely helpful.</p>
<p>You can find it, and directions for using it, at: <a href="http://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Debugging">www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Debugging</a></p>
<p>You can also find a link to the WebGL Inspector there as well, which seems like it might be a really useful tool, but with my small experiments thus far, I haven't had the chance to make use of it.</p>
<p>I also found this nice little utility from mrdoob: <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js">stats.js</a> -- it provides FPS and Milliseconds-Per-Frame numbers (along with little charts) and can provide a memory size statistic too, but for that you need to pass special parameters into chrome/safari (at least at the time of this writing).</p>

  <p>I've been doing a bit of experimentation with languages!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Clojure</em> was interesting, I haven't done much with lisp before, so this was someone of an experience! I definitely enjoyed the absolute simplicity of the syntax and the idea that your code is just data. Fascinating stuff.</li>
<li><em>Scala</em> was different... OO + Functional programming melded together to provide a language with a lot of syntax, but the power to be concise and as fast as any java application.</li>
<li><em>F#</em> -- this one I'm just starting with. It's another OO + Functional language, apparently in the vein of OCaml (which I have zero experience with). So far, I'm rather liking it -- I may even stick with it for long enough to create something substantial with it!</li>
</ul>

  <p>Inspired by (Manic Digger)[http://manicdigger.sourceforge.net/news/], I decided to do some Mono experimentation.</p>
<p>For my experiments, I decided to use OpenTK -- the same as used in ManicDigger.</p>
<p>I am using monodevelop, but I did not realize it doesn't behave like VS in it's build actions -- it does not copy the assemblies required by your application into it's target directory. So I was getting "The entry point method could not be loaded" error messages, but I could not see the rest of the very helpful message, an issue with the setup I was using. I'm not sure if the message was just being clipped, or what.</p>
<p>After a lot of reconfiguring, poking, and googling, my dumb self finally switched to a different setup and saw the rest of the error message:</p>
<pre><code>** (&lt;project directory&gt;/bin/Debug/bd2cs.exe:7982): WARNING **: The following assembly referenced from &lt;project directory&gt;/bin/Debug/bd2cs.exe could not be loaded:
     Assembly:   OpenTK    (assemblyref_index=0)
     Version:    1.0.0.0
     Public Key: bad199fe84eb3df4
The assembly was not found in the Global Assembly Cache, a path listed in the MONO_PATH environment variable, or in the location of the executing assembly (&lt;project directory&gt;/bin/Debug/).

** (&lt;project directory&gt;/bin/Debug/bd2cs.exe:7982): WARNING **: Could not load file or assembly 'OpenTK, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=bad199fe84eb3df4' or one of its dependencies.
The entry point method could not be loaded
</code></pre>
<p>The mono runtime can't find the OpenTK.dll assembly. Simple enough -- just setup a command to execute after the project is built to copy the OpenTK.dll file into the target directory!</p>

  <p>It's been a few weeks since my last post, and I have progressed a little on the project, but not in the last week or so.</p>
<p>Why is development going so slowly? I think it's mostly because of limited time combined with needing to learn a new set of tools. I'm definitely seeing some of the wisdom behind "use what you know, even if it's not 'cool' and new", especially for a side project that you just want to see complete.</p>
<p>Currently I have the ball bouncing around on the screen, and a paddle that responds to touch. The paddle and ball don't interact yet, and there's definitely no AI, scoring, sound, or polish yet.</p>
<p>I think for my next project I'll be using HTML5/Canvas/JS, then embedding the code into an APK. Though, that method has issues too, so I may change my mind again :)</p>

  <p>After I went through the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">documentation</a> for installing the SDK, creating a 'Hello, World' application and publishing the result to a virtual device, and to my actual dev phone, I started putting together an absolutely bare-bones application. It's mostly the <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/articles/glsurfaceview.html">GLSurfaceView example</a>, with a few modifications.</p>
<p>You can view code on my <a href="http://bitbucket.org/jkleier">bitbucket</a> site, the relevant revision of Ping is <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jkleier/ping/src/4094ae4e83ca/">4094ae4e83ca</a>.</p>
<p>I did add a LICENSE, but more for future development than anything that's in the repo at revision 4094ae4e83ca.</p>
<p>Next up: input! Technically, I'm already handling input a little, but it's not configurable!</p>
