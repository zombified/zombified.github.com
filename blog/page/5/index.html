  <p>Inspired by (Manic Digger)[http://manicdigger.sourceforge.net/news/], I decided to do some Mono experimentation.</p>
<p>For my experiments, I decided to use OpenTK -- the same as used in ManicDigger.</p>
<p>I am using monodevelop, but I did not realize it doesn't behave like VS in it's build actions -- it does not copy the assemblies required by your application into it's target directory. So I was getting "The entry point method could not be loaded" error messages, but I could not see the rest of the very helpful message, an issue with the setup I was using. I'm not sure if the message was just being clipped, or what.</p>
<p>After a lot of reconfiguring, poking, and googling, my dumb self finally switched to a different setup and saw the rest of the error message:</p>
<pre><code>** (&lt;project directory&gt;/bin/Debug/bd2cs.exe:7982): WARNING **: The following assembly referenced from &lt;project directory&gt;/bin/Debug/bd2cs.exe could not be loaded:
     Assembly:   OpenTK    (assemblyref_index=0)
     Version:    1.0.0.0
     Public Key: bad199fe84eb3df4
The assembly was not found in the Global Assembly Cache, a path listed in the MONO_PATH environment variable, or in the location of the executing assembly (&lt;project directory&gt;/bin/Debug/).

** (&lt;project directory&gt;/bin/Debug/bd2cs.exe:7982): WARNING **: Could not load file or assembly 'OpenTK, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=bad199fe84eb3df4' or one of its dependencies.
The entry point method could not be loaded
</code></pre>
<p>The mono runtime can't find the OpenTK.dll assembly. Simple enough -- just setup a command to execute after the project is built to copy the OpenTK.dll file into the target directory!</p>

  <p>It's been a few weeks since my last post, and I have progressed a little on the project, but not in the last week or so.</p>
<p>Why is development going so slowly? I think it's mostly because of limited time combined with needing to learn a new set of tools. I'm definitely seeing some of the wisdom behind "use what you know, even if it's not 'cool' and new", especially for a side project that you just want to see complete.</p>
<p>Currently I have the ball bouncing around on the screen, and a paddle that responds to touch. The paddle and ball don't interact yet, and there's definitely no AI, scoring, sound, or polish yet.</p>
<p>I think for my next project I'll be using HTML5/Canvas/JS, then embedding the code into an APK. Though, that method has issues too, so I may change my mind again :)</p>

  <p>After I went through the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">documentation</a> for installing the SDK, creating a 'Hello, World' application and publishing the result to a virtual device, and to my actual dev phone, I started putting together an absolutely bare-bones application. It's mostly the <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/articles/glsurfaceview.html">GLSurfaceView example</a>, with a few modifications.</p>
<p>You can view code on my <a href="http://bitbucket.org/jkleier">bitbucket</a> site, the relevant revision of Ping is <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jkleier/ping/src/4094ae4e83ca/">4094ae4e83ca</a>.</p>
<p>I did add a LICENSE, but more for future development than anything that's in the repo at revision 4094ae4e83ca.</p>
<p>Next up: input! Technically, I'm already handling input a little, but it's not configurable!</p>

  <p>I've decided that it would be interesting to make a few games and put them out on the Android Market. Nothing fancy, just some fun little arcade games. I'm not planning on porting these games to other systems either, so I can focus on using the Java and the Android SDK. I'm also specifically targetting phones, no tablets or TV's, etc. I'm also only targetting devices that have Android 2.x on them, at least for now.</p>
<p>The first game is going to be called 'Ping' -- not really all that original, but it will suffice. It is going to be a 'Pong' clone, and will not have any gameplay elements other than the original. It's just 2 paddles (AI vs Human), 2 'goals', 2 walls, 1 ball, and a score.</p>
<p>My plan is to make the game as polished as I can -- I want smooth animations, crisp graphics, and as few bugs as possible.</p>
<p>My plan is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install and prep Android SDK</li>
<li>Compile sample 'hello world' app and push it to my (dev) phone to make sure everything works</li>
<li>Create a bare-bones app that doesn't do anything except initialize a drawing surface of some kind</li>
<li>Build on the previous app to add input -- input should be reconfigureable by the user (different phones have different inputs). There should be an entirely touch input method.</li>
<li>Build on the previous app to add a background image -- should be reconfigurable by the user</li>
<li>Build on the previous app to add bouncing ball -- there should be no goals yet</li>
<li>Build on the previous app to add 2 paddles -- player should control one of them (which one should be configurable by user)</li>
<li>Build on the previous app to add ball physics to the paddles -- IE, the ball bounces off the paddles</li>
<li>Build on the previous app to add a score-board to the screen</li>
<li>Build on the previous app to remove 2 walls and keep score -- this means tracking when the ball leaves the field, performing a score increment, and reseting the ball</li>
<li>Build on the previous app to make the non-player paddle an ai -- the ai should be configurable as 'easy', 'medium', 'hard', 'impossible'</li>
<li>Clean up the app</li>
<li>Create webpage for it</li>
<li>Publish to Android Market</li>
</ol>
<p>Definitely not comprhensive, but a good framework for me to work within. I've already done steps 1 and 2. My next entry will be about step 3, creating a bare-bones app that doesn't do anything except initialize a drawing surface of some kind.</p>

    <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I decided to get off of Linode, and the first step is moving my website to a host of some sort. I decided that I didn't need all the features of a CMS or big framework (like drupal, plone, etc, etc), especially with the amount of embeddable web services out there!</p>
<p>Instead, I'm opting to statically generate all my sites (more secure, smaller, and less complex). To do this, I use a really nice application by the name of <a href="http://blogofile.com">blogofile</a>. This allows me to template a site, then add content with a somewhat standard formatting language (like <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>).</p>
<p>Another upside to generating a static website is that I can host it pratically anywhere for <em>cheap</em>. The host I ended up picking was Google AppEngine. I picked the AppEngine because it allows me to host a static site (with some fiddling) and allows me to make certain bits of my site dynamic as I need to. It also allows me to host my stuff for free (up to certain quotas, which my site will likely never exceed), and provides a fast distributed system that I don't have to manage at all.</p>
<p>Maybe in a future post I'll go into more detail about my setup, but for now I'm not done yet! I'm just getting started!</p>
