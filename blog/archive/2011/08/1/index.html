  <p>I've been doing a bit of experimentation with languages!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Clojure</em> was interesting, I haven't done much with lisp before, so this was someone of an experience! I definitely enjoyed the absolute simplicity of the syntax and the idea that your code is just data. Fascinating stuff.</li>
<li><em>Scala</em> was different... OO + Functional programming melded together to provide a language with a lot of syntax, but the power to be concise and as fast as any java application.</li>
<li><em>F#</em> -- this one I'm just starting with. It's another OO + Functional language, apparently in the vein of OCaml (which I have zero experience with). So far, I'm rather liking it -- I may even stick with it for long enough to create something substantial with it!</li>

  <p>Inspired by (Manic Digger)[http://manicdigger.sourceforge.net/news/], I decided to do some Mono experimentation.</p>
<p>For my experiments, I decided to use OpenTK -- the same as used in ManicDigger.</p>
<p>I am using monodevelop, but I did not realize it doesn't behave like VS in it's build actions -- it does not copy the assemblies required by your application into it's target directory. So I was getting "The entry point method could not be loaded" error messages, but I could not see the rest of the very helpful message, an issue with the setup I was using. I'm not sure if the message was just being clipped, or what.</p>
<p>After a lot of reconfiguring, poking, and googling, my dumb self finally switched to a different setup and saw the rest of the error message:</p>
<pre><code>** (&lt;project directory&gt;/bin/Debug/bd2cs.exe:7982): WARNING **: The following assembly referenced from &lt;project directory&gt;/bin/Debug/bd2cs.exe could not be loaded:
     Assembly:   OpenTK    (assemblyref_index=0)
     Version:    1.0.0.0
     Public Key: bad199fe84eb3df4
The assembly was not found in the Global Assembly Cache, a path listed in the MONO_PATH environment variable, or in the location of the executing assembly (&lt;project directory&gt;/bin/Debug/).

** (&lt;project directory&gt;/bin/Debug/bd2cs.exe:7982): WARNING **: Could not load file or assembly 'OpenTK, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=bad199fe84eb3df4' or one of its dependencies.
The entry point method could not be loaded
</code></pre>
<p>The mono runtime can't find the OpenTK.dll assembly. Simple enough -- just setup a command to execute after the project is built to copy the OpenTK.dll file into the target directory!</p>
