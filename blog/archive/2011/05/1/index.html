  <p>I decided to get off of Linode, and the first step is moving my website to a host of some sort. I decided that I didn't need all the features of a CMS or big framework (like drupal, plone, etc, etc), especially with the amount of embeddable web services out there!</p>
<p>Instead, I'm opting to statically generate all my sites (more secure, smaller, and less complex). To do this, I use a really nice application by the name of <a href="http://blogofile.com">blogofile</a>. This allows me to template a site, then add content with a somewhat standard formatting language (like <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>).</p>
<p>Another upside to generating a static website is that I can host it pratically anywhere for <em>cheap</em>. The host I ended up picking was Google AppEngine. I picked the AppEngine because it allows me to host a static site (with some fiddling) and allows me to make certain bits of my site dynamic as I need to. It also allows me to host my stuff for free (up to certain quotas, which my site will likely never exceed), and provides a fast distributed system that I don't have to manage at all.</p>
<p>Maybe in a future post I'll go into more detail about my setup, but for now I'm not done yet! I'm just getting started!</p>
