        <p>For the 27th <a href="http://ludumdare.com">Ludum Dare</a> 48-hour game making competition, I created an
entry called <em>Grid Ten</em>. It was my 6th entry into the competition, and needed
to be based around the theme &#39;10 Seconds&#39;. The competition voting isn&#39;t quite
over at the time of this writing, but here are my thoughts on how my game turned
out.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p><strong>Pre- theme annoucement:</strong> I had planned to use <a href="http://inform7.com">Inform 7</a> or <a href="http://www.gimcrackd.com/etc/src/">Twine</a> for
creating a text adventure, but I had also considered <a href="http://haxe.org/">Haxe</a> with <a href="http://haxeflixel.com/">HaxeFlixel</a>
or <a href="http://haxepunk.com/">HaxePunk</a> as a fall-back if I didn&#39;t want to do a text adventure. Other
than that, I went into the competition with no substantial ideas for the direction
I wanted to go.</p>
<p><strong>Theme Announcement:</strong> The IRC chat room was full of hate for &#39;10 Seconds&#39;, and
I just knew this was the theme going to be picked. So, when it was announced,
I was already thinking about what I could do. Initially I started drafting some
sort of story that would revolve around using &#39;10 seconds&#39; in the context of a
lat/long coordinate. I actually spent a good 4 hours working on this concept
before going to bed for the night.</p>
<p><strong>The next morning:</strong> With the announcement happening only 4 or so hours before
I went to bed, it gave my subconcious a good chance to mull over what I had worked
on the night before. When I woke up, I started having doubts about my ideas from
the night before -- none of them were really &#39;gelling&#39; with me. So after about
2 hours, I came upon the core idea for what turned into <em>Grid Ten</em>, which was
definitely not a text-adventure.</p>
<p><strong>The rest of the first day:</strong> After getting the core concept for <em>Grid Ten</em>
fleshed out a bit more, I decided to forgo Haxe, etc, and just work directly
with html/css/javascript. It&#39;s a toolset I&#39;m really familiar with, and my
concept would work very well with programmatically generated textures that I
thought would be easier to do with the canvas element than with HaxeFlixel or
HaxePunk. I also decided I didn&#39;t want a compile step in my development, nor
did I want to deal with flash. The majority of the work went really smooth,
I was really able to focus in on just the minimum code necessary -- I actually
had some code to implement tails for the enemies, but then I quickly saw that
that code would just bloat the game unnecessarily. It got cut out pretty quick,
I didn&#39;t just comment it out, I completely removed it. I didn&#39;t want anything
that would distract my focus. At the end of the day, I had the mechanics that
I was shooting for pretty well fleshed out. There was still a LOT to add to the
game, but the very core was in place!</p>
<p><strong>Day 2:</strong> I spent a good 7 hours polishing everything up -- I added some
primitive animations, another &#39;block&#39; the player could place, I also did some
optimizations and improved the &#39;intelligence&#39; of the enemies and added a menu,
and a end-game screen. Generally, I polished the thing up quit a bit. I did
stop early, around 3pm, to start the process of packaging and releasing. I&#39;ll
talk about this a bit more later, but I should have definitely kept at it for
at least another 2 or 3 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Post- competition end:</strong> I ended up fixing a bug whereby user placed blocks
would stick around after a reset. Small, and easily fixed, but I should have
totally caught that before submission!</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The GOOD</h2>
<ul>
<li>I leveraged a platform that I know fairly well</li>
<li>I stuck really well to a plan for absolute minimum viable product -- I didn&#39;t
put a lot of extra cruft into the game that I didn&#39;t think significantly
improved the experience. Take, for example, the start and end screens -- I
put a large &#39;bouncing&#39; text on both screens which didn&#39;t add anything to
game-play, but it made the start and end screens much less boring to look
at, which is important for first impressions I think.</li>
<li>I got plenty of sleep and food (always important!)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-bad">The BAD</h2>
<p>There are really only three things I think were really bad this time around:</p>
<ul>
<li>I basically scratched and restarted what I was doing after about 6 hours
total of development time. This hurt -- but, to be fair, I wasn&#39;t &#39;feeling&#39;
the text-adventure I started with, and it was probably good for my sanity
to restart with the game I did.</li>
<li>I quit 2 or 3 hours earlier than I really should have, and in that time I
probably could have done quite a lot of polishing.</li>
<li>I used mostly original code -- I used zero game related engines/frameworks</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-ugly">The UGLY</h2>
<p>Overall I&#39;m really happy with the project, and I think the core concept has a
lot of potential. I see a few ways that it could grow and change, and I&#39;m
actually pretty excited to continue working on this game in my down time.</p>
<p>However, I think I&#39;ll probably end up re-writing most of it. The style I used
to code the game isn&#39;t sustainable I think... growing the project much larger
would hurt, especially adding some of the mechanics into it that I have ideas
for. I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ll have to write every piece of code from scratch, but
good chunks of it for sure.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I think I&#39;ve gotten some fairly positive comments on my <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-27/?action=preview&amp;uid=7263">entry page</a>,
and I got around a 2.5 out of 5, which is about where I was expecting this time
around. If there were more mechanics and more polish, then I think I would have
absolutely nailed it.</p>
<p>Next time!</p>
