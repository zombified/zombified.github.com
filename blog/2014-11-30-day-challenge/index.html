<p>The next 30 days are going to pass whether you like it or not, so why not think
about something you&#8217;ve always wanted to try, and give it a shot!</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Matt Cutts in his TED Talk "Try something new for 30 days"
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Those words really resonated with me when I watched
<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days">Matt Cutt&#8217;s TED Talk</a>,
and launched into the idea of writing a blog post once per day for 30 days.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I latched onto writing on my blog because for <em>years</em> it&#8217;s been a very inconsistent,
on/off activity&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;one that had close to the lowest priority in my life. Inverting
the priority of this activity has forced me to really consider the how and
why&#8217;s of keeping a blog.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What I&#8217;ve discovered:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>I can&#8217;t post something unless I give it an hour or more of my attention (the
quality of the writing goes way down with less time, to the point where I
am writing what essentially amounts to a long-form tweet or a facebook/g+
type of post)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of the posts I&#8217;m particuarly happy with were written either early in
the morning before work or before dinner time (the longer I put it off, the
more likely I was to fall into the trap of posting filler for filler&#8217;s sake)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing down questions about, and snippets of, code that I don&#8217;t understand
<em>really</em> helped me focus and gain a deeper understanding than I would have
if I just <em>looked</em> at it&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;subsequently, I feel like these were some of my
best posts in terms of content (if not in quality of writing)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filler for filler&#8217;s sake makes nobody happy&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The result of this challenge has really made me think about how I want to write,
how often I want to write, and what I feel like I&#8217;m good(ish) at writing. The
conclusion I&#8217;ve come too is that I don&#8217;t what to write a <em>post</em> every day. I just
end up with lots of filler that clutters up my blog and makes it look a little
more trashy and irrelevant.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve considered how to proceed, and I think I still want to write and work on
a post or article every day, but only publish once per week. There are times
when I think I&#8217;ll probably post more&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;I post everything to the main blog, and
then have a 'brewlog' which is a tagged subset of posts about brewing&#8230;&#8203; those
posts, and similiar posts, will probably still be published irreguarly. I won&#8217;t
be considering those posts my weekly article.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The subject matter I&#8217;ve enjoyed most this past month has definitely been the
<em>Nim!</em> posts&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;writing was a great way to focus and clarify the process of
learning Nim. In the future, I&#8217;d like to continue to apply this technique to
learning more than just new computer languages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In short:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Posting just to post is out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&#8217;m going to post a regular article once per week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My regular article will be about <em>learning</em> something new.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My regular article will be made with intent, not on the spur of the moment</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What&#8217;s next? <a href="http://joelkleier.com/blog/2014-11-physics/">Yesterday</a> I posted
about wanting to brush off some dust on my math skills and really learn how to
do proper physical simulation in (2D) games. Specifically, I&#8217;m considering writing
about developing a Nim library or framework for simple 2D physics&#8230;&#8203; purely as
an exercise to develop my understanding of the math required in such a case.</p>
