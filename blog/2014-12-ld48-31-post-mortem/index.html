<p>In a sentance, the Ludum Dare is an event that acts as a focal point for learning
how to eschew distraction and unnecessary complication. I encourage you to
<a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/">check it out</a>!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The theme this year was <em>Entire Game on One Screen</em>, and my entry is called

<p>I absolutely <em>love</em> this "competition" because it emphasizes the <em>process</em> of
creating something over the final product. Certainly, high scores and
premium placement post-competition are desireable, but not so desirable that
they become an overriding focus for participants.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Above all, it&#8217;s an opportunity to mark dedicated time on my calendar for practice
of a skill that requires perpetual attention to master: the ability to focus
and perform efficiently, simply, and quickly.</p>

<li>
<p>My wife was absolutely amazing&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it is <strong>very</strong> important to have the support of
those you love and respect when every part of you is tired and your mind is
practically putty. Every word of encouragment helps renew commitement
to the process of seeing the 48-hours through.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tooling&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;I made a concious effort to look back at my previous entries and
use only tooling that I felt I did good work with. To that end, I used
<a href="https://love2d.org">LÃ–VE</a>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a framework that you script with Lua. Not my
favorite language, but the community is solid, the documentation is good,
and the tools are easy to dive into.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Twitter turned out to be a very motivating tool&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;<em>#LDJAM</em> was trending so
every tweet got quite a bit of attention, this was really the first time
I&#8217;ve interacted with complete strangers so actively. Normally I just lurk
in social environments, but this was definitely a positive experience and
it makes me curious how much more useful it could be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.gifgrabber.com/">GifGrabber</a> and <a href="https://imageoptim.com/">ImageOptim</a>
are two fantastic tools for generating short little progress "videos"&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and
the "videos" were a motivation all in themselves. After taking a series of
these throughout my game, it let me reflect on my progress much more
visually that a static screenshot (or nothing at all) would. This is
surprisingly powerful, epsecially when you are working on something that is
very dynamic and visual by nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I stayed hydrated and didn&#8217;t starve myself&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;seemingly irrelevant maybe,
but this is an important one. Learned that lesson <em>long</em> ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My recent (incomplete) dive into 2d game physics <em>really</em> helped out. Not
a particuarly impressive example, but I was quite proud of myself when I
finished the code to dynamically create polygonal circles, then deform them
in such a manner to make them appear to be odd-shaped asteroids! It was a
moment that I would have normally gone hunting for examples online. This time
I thought through the entire problem, and already <em>knew</em> how to solve it.
Such a small thing, but so very motivating.</p>

<li>
<p>Distraction! I spent about 3 hours watching TV that I <em>could</em> have been
making my game better! To be fair, some level of distraction is required
to maintain sanity in stressful situations, but 3 hours seems to be more
than I needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didn&#8217;t didn&#8217;t <em>stop</em> when I was getting tired on the second night&#8230;&#8203; which
just put me behind&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;not only did I make bad decisions, I ended up short
changing myself by over-sleeping the next day and not getting as much work
done as I could have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If economy of time is important, don&#8217;t explore unfamiliar tools, and if you
do <em>have</em> to, make certain they <em>are</em> the right tool for the job before you
invest time into using them. In my case, this was <code>love.physics</code>. Really
cool, but <em>way</em> over-kill, and trying to use it cost me about 4-hours of
work.</p>

<p>Everytime I participate, it strengthens my ability to just <em>get stuff done</em> and
forces me out of the "decision paralysis" mindset. All to often it is easy to
get into a state where <em>analysis</em> of a problem turns into <em>decision paralysis</em>.
This state is the death of productivity of any kind, and turns into avoidance
or pure laziness. Bad habits.</p>

<p>This was my first participation in the Ludum Dare in about a year, and I&#8217;m glad
I did it. Will I be doing this again? If life permits (and it is a priority
of mine to make sure it does), you bet!</p>
