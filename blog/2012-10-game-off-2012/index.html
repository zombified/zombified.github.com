            <p><strong>Edit (2013-03-06):</strong> moved haxe related stuff to a <a href="/posts/2012/10/haxepunk-linearpath-tween.html">different post</a></p>
            <h3 id="github-game-off-2012">Github Game-Off 2012</h3>
            <p><a href="http://github.com">Github</a> is hosting a game making <a href="http://github.com/github/game-off-2012" title="Game-Off 2012 Repository">competition</a> through the month of November.</p>
            <p>It needs to be playable in a web browser, and needs to have some relation to &quot;branching&quot;, &quot;forking&quot;, &quot;cloning&quot;, &quot;pushing&quot;, or &quot;pulling&quot;.</p>
            <p>Sounds like fun, I think I'm in :)</p>
            <p>I'll blog about my trials and tribulations here, so expect to see more posts about this project.</p>
            <p>So far I've settled on a few things:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>The game is going to be heavily influenced by <a href="http://github.com">Hero Quest</a>, one of my all-time favorite board games</li>
            <li><p>The game will be broadly considered a &quot;tactical rpg&quot; with less of an emphasis on some of the typical staples from RPG's that I tend to find tedious:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>There's no explicit traveling -- IE the goal of the game will be to finish the level, for whatever goals the level has. Transition between levels will be the purview of narrative occuring between levels.</li>
            <li>All equipment will be purchased through a between-level store mechanism</li>
            <li>There are 2 stats: Offense/Defense. Might end up calling them something else, but 'Offense' and 'Defense' describes their purpose fairly well. These stats can be modified by equipment, and, very slowly, experience overtime.</li>
            <li>Experience is rewarded at the end of a mission -- each mission has a base amount of experience to give to each character that survives, and then each character gets a small amount of experience per enemy slain, chest opened, secret found, and item retrieved.</li>
            <li>No equipment can be found in the levels. Anything found is essentially money and experience.</li>
            <li>There will be no 'looting' -- IE the environment will not contains barrels, chests, etc, that are only their to smash or open. Chests will be special and only contain rare items that can be converted to money at the end of the mission.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><p>I'll be making the game in <a href="http://haxe.org">Haxe</a>/<a href="http://haxenme.org">NME</a>, and I'll be taking advantage of <a href="http://haxepunk.com">HaxePunk</a>. Sadly, the html5 build for NME seems not to like how HaxePunk is made, so I'll be putting out a flash version of the game for the competition.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>My immediate goal for this next week is to get the basic game play prototyped out, IE, I want a map displaying with boundaries, and character movement, and combat. That's glossing over a lot of details, but it comes down to that.</p>
