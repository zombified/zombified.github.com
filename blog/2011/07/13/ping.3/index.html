  <p>It's been a few weeks since my last post, and I have progressed a little on the project, but not in the last week or so.</p>
<p>Why is development going so slowly? I think it's mostly because of limited time combined with needing to learn a new set of tools. I'm definitely seeing some of the wisdom behind "use what you know, even if it's not 'cool' and new", especially for a side project that you just want to see complete.</p>
<p>Currently I have the ball bouncing around on the screen, and a paddle that responds to touch. The paddle and ball don't interact yet, and there's definitely no AI, scoring, sound, or polish yet.</p>
<p>I think for my next project I'll be using HTML5/Canvas/JS, then embedding the code into an APK. Though, that method has issues too, so I may change my mind again :)</p>
