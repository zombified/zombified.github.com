  <p>I've uploaded a semi playable version, <a href="/projects/ping/">play it here</a>!</p>
<p>I'm definitely not done with it, I still have a start screen, pause screen, win/loss screen, better AI, font tweaks, game play tweaks, and a lot of testing to do.</p>
<p>However, I want to move onto "Blocks of Desctruction 2", a break-out like game, which was originally going to be a follow-up to my tetris like game, <a href="/projects/bd/bd.html">Blocks of Destruction</a>.</p>
<p>I started experimenting with various platforms and used Pong as a problem to solve. My intention was never to create a full featured pong game, all I wanted was an easy(ish) problem to solve while tinkering!</p>
<p>Ultimately, I need to stop tinkering and experimenting. So now <a href="/projects/ping/">Ping</a> will be put on hold, perhaps indefinitely, and I will start working on "Blocks of Descruction 2".</p>
<p>I will be posting something each and every day that I work on the game, so, stay tuned imaginary internet people!</p>
