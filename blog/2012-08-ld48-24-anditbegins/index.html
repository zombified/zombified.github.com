            <p>Evolution.</p>
            <p>Let's see what I can do!</p>
            <h4 id="august-24th-1">[23:38 August 24th]</h4>
            <p>Well, after a few hours of racking my brain, possibly a short nap, and some down time with the missus, I have an idea. Not a very complicated or original one, but one that I think has some potential.</p>
            <p>Here's a first look at it:</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="/pics/LD48_24_FLOW_201208242338.png" title="FLOW" alt="FLOW, Screen Shot at 23:38 on 24 August 2012"><figcaption>FLOW, Screen Shot at 23:38 on 24 August 2012</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Not much to see, and not much to do in it, but it's a start!</p>
            <p>Time for bed.</p>
            <h4 id="august-25th">[6:45 August 25th]</h4>
            <p>Rested, and ready to go!</p>
            <p>My goal for today is to have the entirety of gameplay done:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Eat small blobs, grow bigger</li>
            <li>Get hit by bigger blobs, grow smaller</li>
            <li>Start overlay</li>
            <li>Dead/End overlay</li>
            <li>Pause overlay</li>
            <li>Sounds</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My goal for tomorrow:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Fix up the UI</li>
            <li>Add some animations</li>
            <li>Fancy shit up</li>
            <li>Add bonus and penalty blobs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'm certain that my plans will change, but here goes nothing!</p>
            <h4 id="august-25th-1">[7:30 August 25th]</h4>
            <p>Refactored some of my code a little, and added in some basic collision detection.</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="/pics/LD48_24_FLOW_20120825728.png" title="Basic Collision Detection" alt="FLOW, Screen Shot at 7:28 on 25 August 2012"><figcaption>FLOW, Screen Shot at 7:28 on 25 August 2012</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now it's time for a shower and breakfast. Let's start this day off right!</p>
            <h4 id="august-25th-2">[11:46 August 25th]</h4>
            <p>The game mechanics are shaping up nicely! I think there's a little more tweaking I want to do before I start on the menu's and sounds, but it's (IMO) quite enjoyable for a quick 5 minutes of play.</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="/pics/LD48_24_FLOW_201208251148.png" title="You must survive!" alt="FLOW, Screen Shot at 11:48 on 25 August 2012"><figcaption>FLOW, Screen Shot at 11:48 on 25 August 2012</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h4 id="august-25th-3">[14:04 August 25th]</h4>
            <p>I've got the start and end screens functioning the way I want them, and I've pretty much stopped tweaking the mechanic. I think it is good enough the more I play it. There's lots of things that I could add in to it... like a blob that would keep you the same size, an ability to push or pull all the blobs aound the mouse and such.</p>
            <p>I've also come to think that the game is an analogy for life, so I'm rolling with it.</p>
            <p>I do need to come up with a better name than 'FLOW' though, as it's just my working title.</p>
            <p>Here's the death screen:</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="/pics/LD48_24_FLOW_201208251403.png" title="Shit, you&#39;re dead." alt="FLOW, Screen Shot at 14:03 on 25 August 2012"><figcaption>FLOW, Screen Shot at 14:03 on 25 August 2012</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h4 id="august-25th-4">[18:13 August 25th]</h4>
            <p>Quick update before I eat dinner. I was going kinda slow this afternoon, but the &quot;high scores&quot; are displaying and the player can ether their name.</p>
            <p>I'm going to work on a easter egg next... :)</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="/pics/LD48_24_FLOW_201208251812.png" title="The start screen" alt="FLOW, Screen Shot at 18:12 on 25 August 2012"><figcaption>FLOW, Screen Shot at 18:12 on 25 August 2012</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h4 id="august-25th-5">[21:58 August 25th]</h4>
            <p>Added the easter egg! Not going to say what it is or post a screenshot of it, of course!</p>
            <p>Also added music. I am by no means a music guy, so it shouldn't surprise you that it's nothing fancy. Might add a little more tomorrow before I submit the game, but, honestly, I don't know.</p>
            <p>Since I spent most of my time on sound stuff, don't really have a screen shot!</p>
            <p>Next, I have a little intro text to put on the start screen, then we have to rename the project to something official like.</p>
            <h4 id="august-26th">[0:28 August 26th]</h4>
            <p>Still going strong, decided to create a custom fixed-width font for more alignment!</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="/pics/LD48_24_FLOW_201208260027.png" title="A New Font" alt="FLOW, Screen Shot at 0:27 on 26 August 2012"><figcaption>FLOW, Screen Shot at 0:27 on 26 August 2012</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h4 id="august-26th-1">[9:33 August 26th]</h4>
            <p>Woke up refreshed, had some eggs, and started digging into more polish!</p>
            <p>I added a death sound, made the text a little more readable, added an instruction on how to quit the game (which is probably error prone -- not really sure how to detect OSs/Window Managers well, so the arrow and message may be on the wrong side of the screen for releases like Kubuntu), and changed the title! It is now called &quot;And Thus She Spake&quot;.</p>
            <p>Here's a screen shot, you can see some of the updated text and the new title:</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="/pics/LD48_24_ANDTHUSSHESPAKE_201208260932.png" title="And Thus She Spake" alt="And Thus She Spake, Screen Shot at 9:32 on 26 August 2012"><figcaption>And Thus She Spake, Screen Shot at 9:32 on 26 August 2012</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h4 id="august-26th-2">[12:53 August 26th]</h4>
            <p>Well, with around 7 hours to go I've finished bundling and releasing to the extent that I'm going to do.</p>
            <p>Here's a link to the entry (just the preview, not the voting page): <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&amp;uid=7263">And Thus She Spake</a></p>
            <p>Here's my releases:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/48144436/LD48/24/And%20Thus%20She%20Spake.love">LÖVE File</a> (Make sure to install [LÖVE] separatly)</li>
            <li><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/48144436/LD48/24/AndThusSheSpake-osx.zip">OS/X</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/48144436/LD48/24/AndThusSheSpake-win-x86.zip">Win 32-bit</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/48144436/LD48/24/AndThusSheSpake-win-x64.zip">Win 64-bit</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Linux users will have to install LÖVE separately and run the <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/48144436/LD48/24/And%20Thus%20She%20Spake.love">LÖVE File</a> as I am not familiar with bundling on those platforms, and there aren't any straight forward directions to follow to bundle for LÖVE.</p>
            <p>And one last screenshot:</p>
