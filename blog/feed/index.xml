      <description>Creating a Dexterity Type with Dynamic Fields</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Currently I'm working on a product to manage events (<a href="https://github.com/zombified/collective.eventmanager">collective.eventmanager</a>) for <a href="http://wildcardcorp.com/">Wildcard Corp.</a>. This event manager requires that people register for events -- but each event's registration form may contain different fields.</p>
<p>So, working with <a href="http://www.nathanvangheem.com/">Nathan Van Gheem</a>, we figured out a way to make a dexterity type read in a list of field descriptions at runtime, then generate normal add and edit forms.</p>
<p>I have to say, though, that Nathan did most of the figuring -- I was definitely going off on unworkable paths.</p>
<p>Anyway, it turns out it's really quite simple.</p>
<p>The meat of it is in <a href="https://github.com/zombified/collective.eventmanager/blob/cb28455a7e89fa0ed2821314a8e57a55414230b9/collective/eventmanager/registration.py">registration.py</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>IRegistration</em> interface defines a few fields that will always be associated with a registration item, and is a regular interface used to define a zope schema for use with dexterity.</p>
<p>To add other fields dynamically, the Edit and Add forms need to be customized, as seen with the <em>EditForm</em> and <em>AddForm</em> classes. In each of the classes, we override the <em>updateFields</em> method, but the call to the <em>addDynamicFields</em> method does most of the work:</p>
<pre><code>def addDynamicFields(form, reg_fields):
    for fielddata in reg_fields:
        field = getattr(schema, fielddata['fieldtype'])(
                    title=unicode(fielddata['name']),
                    required=fielddata['required'])
        field.__name__ = str(fielddata['name'])
        field.interface = IRegistration
        utils.add(form, field)
</code></pre>
<p>It, essentially, is taking a list of field definitions. We've chosen to only have a Name, Type, and Required attribute for each field dynamically created, so when we call <em>getattr</em>, we are creating a field based on the through-the-web (dynamic) values.</p>
<p>The field is given a name, and, the most important part, we assign it's interface to be the <em>IRegistration</em> interface, which is used to define the Registration type through the normal dexterity process.</p>
<p>The last line of the funciton calls the <em>utils.add</em> method located in <em>plone.z3cform.fieldsets</em> -- this adds the field to the form and correctly updates everything.</p>
<p>Check out the code, it's pretty slick! Big thank you to Nathan for figuring a bunch of that stuff out!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>I'm Not Dead Yet!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last several months have been quite eventful for me, and this poor excuse for a blog has been low on my list of priorities -- but no longer!. Well, maybe it's moved up a notch or two.</p>
<p>I will probably continue my declare 'MelonJS' articles soon, but for now I am on to other things.</p>
<p>First up is my <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&amp;uid=7263">ludum dare #23 entry</a>, a text adventure called 'The Tiny World'. It's not fancy, and it's built from scratch (I know, I know -- I probably should have just gone with inform7). Play it if you like, it's probably mediocre at best!</p>
<p>Second up, my new job is a lot about Python and, more specifically, Plone, so expect to see some posts on those things.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>MelonJS pt 1</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last December I <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&amp;uid=7263">participated</a> in the <a href="http://ludumdare.com">Ludum Dare</a> (#22), and ultimately used <a href="http://www.melonjs.org">melonJS</a> as my framework of choice.</p>
<p>The next Ludum Dare is coming up, and this time it's the 10th anniversary of the competition!</p>
<p>I need to be prepared.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have decided to do a short series, for my benefit, on how to make a melonJS game.</p>
<p>The game I will be developing is going to be called <em>Minefield</em>, and is based off of the <em>Doger</em> game from <a href="http://inventwithpython.com/chapter20.html">Invent With Python</a>.</p>
<p>The full source code will be found on <a href="http://github.com">github</a> under my <a href="https://github.com/zombified/minefield">minefield</a> project. Specifically, the code in this post can be found at <a href="https://github.com/zombified/minefield/tree/a6b40e8ec2d495d6589ccfc9166d2e65649647ac">this commit</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>All required files to make this app work are stored in the repository. The <code>libs</code> directory contains all libraries used that aren't specifically created for this project.</p>
<p>There are only 2 significant files (outside of melonJS) in the repo so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>index.html</li>
<li>js/PlayScreen.js</li>
</ol>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/zombified/minefield/blob/a6b40e8ec2d495d6589ccfc9166d2e65649647ac/index.html">index.html</a></h3>
<p>This is where most of the magic happens for the base structure needed for the game.</p>
<p>Check out the source, the code is fairly small, and all the important sections have comments.</p>
<p>The one line that I'd like to make a note about is:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id="app"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>It provides a location for melonJS to create it's render surface. The ID is arbitrary, and is used in the call to "<code>me.video.init</code>".</p>
<h3>PlayScreen.js</h3>
<p>For now, this is just an empty object. We will be using this object to build up our PLAY state later on.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Updates</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I Decided to sit down and design a new theme, which is still rough and in development. </p>
<p>I also decided it was time to move my website over to github. This is for a couple of reasons... so I don't have all my eggs in one basket (Google), and so I don't have to do as much maintenance.</p>
<p>Basically the appengine tools are tools that I only use for updating my website/blog. Why not replace those tools with a single tool that I use for other stuff to?</p>
<p>Now I just need to use git, which I don't have to manually update and setup since it's in my OS's package repositories! Woohoo, less work for me!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>The Bob Compiler</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Check out one of my old college projects I recently dug up: <a href="https://github.com/zombified/bobcompiler">the bob compiler</a>.</p>
<p>My first real big Python program made over the span of a semester in 2007, for a compiler course.</p>
<p>It's hardly commented, horribly designed, and poorly coded, but I'm still proud of how much effor I put into this little project. As I recall we were only ever intended to create a single-pass compiler that simply interpreted tokens as it read them, and spit out assembly as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Instead, I chose to make primitive parser, lexer, semantic analyzer, and translator components. Eventually I was planning on adding optimization options, but I never got to it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spent a little time re-arranging my website. Nothing fancy, just a few tweaks. I kind of like it plain text... need to find the time to style it slightly though. The typeface is hurting my eyes a little.</p>
<p>Also updated my twitter username! 'pbdiode'. Figured I'd stick with it since that's what I'm registered at <a href="http://ludumdare.com">ld48</a> with. It's time for a change I think.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>We Have Sound</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>10 Days left until the event!</p>
<p>I will be recording the event -- I'll be using 'recordmydesktop', with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>recordmydesktop --no-sound --on-the-fly-encoding --v_quality 30 --no-frame
</code></pre>
<p>Then I just let it sit! Hopefully I'll have enough disk space... it is set to record at a crappy quality, so I should have enough space. And my tests indicate the text is at least readable... eh. We'll see.</p>
<p>Now on to finding out about audio...</p>
<p>WolframTones seems interesting, but I can't seem to get firefox configured correctly for it. I'm also having issues setting up PulseAudio, so I may have issues recording even a tone matrix output. Ugh.</p>
<p>I think I'm just going to forego the music for now. Less to stress me out, less to actually work on during the competition. I will, at least, have good sound effects from sfxr!</p>
<p>So, what do I need to do next to prepare?</p>
<ul>
<li>I know what tech I'm using -- Javascript/HTML/CSS, melonJS</li>
<li>I'm axing the music generation</li>
<li>I have my tools ready -- a terminal, tmux, vim, chromium and firefox, sfxr, gimp, recordmydesktop, tiled</li>
<li>I've posted an 'I'm In' message on the ludum dare website (http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2011/12/06/im-in-255/) -- I posted under 'pbdiode', supposedly pronounced 'lead diode'. I think it sounded better in my head.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it's time I practice a bit. I think I'll do some exercises to get myself more familiar with melonJS.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Ludum Dare</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just found out that the Ludum Dare #22 is in 11 days! I'm totally in.</p>
<p>To start preparing I've started playing with some music generation stuff, since, out of all my weaknesses, music and sound effects are by far my most weakest point::</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html">sfxr</a></li>
<li><a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net">Audacity</a></li>
<li><a href="http://lab.andre-michelle.com/tonematrix">Tone Matrix</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.inudge.net/">inudge -- another tone matrix</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I still need to figure out how to do some stuff with pulse audio so that I can record sounds generated by applications, then I can use the tone matrix apps to generate the music, and audacity to capture it.</p>
<p>I'll definitely be writing more about this!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Eat All The Things! p1</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that I'm done moving, and Thanksgiving has come and gone, it's time to jump back into the fray.</p>
<p>I've decided that I've learned enough from "Blocks of Destruction 2", and will be moving on to my next project. It will be a 'Pac-Man' like game.</p>
<p>I've chosen to move back to HTML+CSS+JAVASCRIPT.</p>
<p>Why? Because, frankly I am nearly paralyzed with indecision about what tech to use, and not at all focusing on my end goal. I needed to pick something, so I fell back to old faithful.</p>
<p>Now:</p>
<p><em>What I've Done</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Setup basic <a href="http://www.melonjs.org">melonJS</a> app</li>
<li>rendering my custom map</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Screen Shot (s)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>none today, sorry!</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Near Future TODO</em></p>
<ul>
<li>load character entity on screen</li>
<li>setup character animation</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

<ul>
<li>Added background image (very very rough -- not final image by any means)</li>
<li>Added some textures for the bricks</li>
<li>Added the mouse events for the game state manager (even though I don't use them yet)</li>
<li>Decided that using a fixed-frame rate was enough, and that's all I'm doing for timing for this game</li>
<li>Added the selection indicator triangle on menu</li>

<ul>
<li>Spend more time creating a better background</li>
<li>Implement player lives</li>
<li>Add texture for paddle and ball</li>
<li>Start implementing a game-over state -- for now just show if player won or lost</li>
