    <article id='page-content' class='post'>
        <div class="paragraph">
<p>I would recommend anyone who has the chance, see
<a href="https://interstellar.withgoogle.com/">Insterstellar</a>. It&#8217;s almost 3 hours, but
its 3 hours of awesome. I&#8217;ll try not to be spoilery here, so you
should be safe to keep reading.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ultimately, it&#8217;s a story about love, and not a story without it&#8217;s faults. What
it does well, in my opinion, is tell a tail of the future that is at least
<em>plausible</em>. One where humanity faces a crisis of extinction and must fight
to over come it. No robots take over the earth, there&#8217;s no specific apocolypic
event, and there&#8217;s no direct political motivations influencing the course of
the movie.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the topic of extinction, one of my favorite thought experiments is
<a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html?doing_wp_cron=1415474450.1038939952850341796875">The Firmi Paradox</a>.
I suggest reading the article, as it does a much better job of explaining, but
I&#8217;ll attempt to paraphrase:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The whole paradox is based on the question 'Where is everybody?' when we look
to the stars and can detect no other signs of life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This question leads to something else called the <em>The Great Filter</em>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a theory
that says that there are common eveolutionary steps for every species, but
there is one step that almost <em>no</em> spieces cross, perhaps because it&#8217;s very unlikely,
or perhaps because it&#8217;s impossible. This step allows a species to evolve to the
point where it can leverage the power found with in an entire galaxy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, if this filter is <em>behind</em> us, then we, humans, are a rarity in the universe,
perhaps even unique if this 'filter' is so hard that in the multible <em>billions</em>
of years of the universes existence, no other species has been able to overcome it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another possibility is that this filter doesn&#8217;t really exist (yet) because the
universe is to young to have developed it. Maybe life is
simply not old enough to have been able to support a species that can span
galaxies. Perhaps we are on the leading edge, along with other species that have
also not left their planets yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Or maybe, and this is the <em>really</em> depressing thought, the great filter is <em>ahead</em>
of us, and we are on a collision course for an extinciton event that is very likely
to destroy us.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And so, with this line of thinking, no news is good news. If we find simple life
on Mars, or another celestial body, it eliminates a bunch of possible events that
have already occured as being "The Great Filter", making it more likely that it
is ahead of us. If we find fossils of <em>complex</em> life, it would mean that it is
likely the filter is <em>ahead</em> of us, and that, in all likely hood, we would be
doomed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, there&#8217;s a lot more the the article I linked, but those are my favorite
bits of it. How does this relate to Interstellar? Well, you need to watch it to
find out :D</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ll say this: the Great Filter is where my thoughts drifted after the film, not
during it. The movie is about humans and their chance to not be extinct, not about
aliens and galactic civilizations!</p>
