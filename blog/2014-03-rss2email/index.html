            <p>March 13, 2013 -- Google <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html">announced</a> the shutdown of Google Reader. Honestly, I became a little pissed. I mean, I certainly didn't use Reader a lot, but it was <em>so</em> convenient to keep track of my podcasts and news, especially the ones that weren't updated often. It also, usually, gave me a pretty good history of posts, beyond what was listed in the feed.</p>
            <p>Alas, it was not to be, and, in the end, it's probably a good thing. The shutdown did one great thing: it forced me to find a <em>better</em> solution for <em>my</em> use case.</p>
            <p>At this point, the hunt was on. I tried <a href="http://feedly.com/index.html#discover">Feedly</a>, but it didn't fit my wants. I had a problem with the plugins and how you viewed feeds. Then I moved on to <a href="https://theoldreader.com/">The Old Reader</a>, which was mostly a clone of Google Reader, but a clone of the good parts before Google started futzing with it!</p>
            <p>For awhile, it was nice and useful. Quickly, though, it became apparent to me that it was <em>another</em> service I had to log into, and it didn't have a great mobile offering. It was a little slow due to the massive attention it was getting, and they even announced that they would have to shutdown at one point.</p>
            <p>That announcement and the troubles I was running into with the app made me realize -- I had gone from one service that held the keys to the information I wanted, into to the hands of another.</p>
            <p>This realization forced me to work a little harder on a side project: <a href="https://github.com/zombified/slicerss">slicerss</a>, which has since been pretty much abandoned. This project let me really customize how I wanted to read my rss feeds. I setup a very minimal UI, and it had all the (minimal) features I needed out of it. But, it was slow... and bound to my home server.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, I discovered the key to what I want: I don't want to even <em>check</em> another service, and most of the time I just want to view the original article anyway. I don't want to share (most of the time) or organize my feeds.</p>
            <p>I just want a river of news that makes it easy to mark or save an article and a link to the original.</p>
            <p>Enter <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rss2email">rss2email</a> - a project which has been in development since at least 2006 (that's the date of v2.56 in the changelog). What does it do? Very simply, it downloads a set of RSS feeds, keeps track of which ones it has sent you, and emails the ones it hasn't.</p>
            <p>Super, super, simple. Zero dependence on 3rd party services or proprietary software, an active project, and minimal system requirements. Plus, it's available anywhere I can access my email! I can use my email system to flag/pin/star or save any particular articles I want to, and I can just delete the rest.</p>
            <p>Why I didn't do this sooner? Beats me. Now I just have a cron job that runs <code>r2e run</code> once a day, and then, when I want to, I can just check my email.</p>
