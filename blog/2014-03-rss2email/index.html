        <p>March 13, 2013 -- Google <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html">announced</a> the shutdown of Google Reader. Honestly,
I became a little pissed. I mean, I certainly didn&#39;t use Reader a lot, but it
was <em>so</em> convenient to keep track of my podcasts and news, especially the ones
that weren&#39;t updated often. It also, usually, gave me a pretty good history
of posts, beyond what was listed in the feed.</p>
<p>Alas, it was not to be, and, in the end, it&#39;s probably a good thing. The
shutdown did one great thing: it forced me to find a <em>better</em> solution for
<em>my</em> use case.</p>
<p>At this point, the hunt was on. I tried <a href="http://feedly.com/index.html#discover">Feedly</a>, but it didn&#39;t fit my
wants. I had a problem with the plugins and how you viewed feeds. Then I
moved on to <a href="https://theoldreader.com/">The Old Reader</a>, which was mostly a clone of Google Reader,
but a clone of the good parts before Google started futzing with it!</p>
<p>For awhile, it was nice and useful. Quickly, though, it became apparent to me
that it was <em>another</em> service I had to log into, and it didn&#39;t have a great
mobile offering. It was a little slow due to the massive attention it was
getting, and they even announced that they would have to shutdown at one point.</p>
<p>That announcement and the troubles I was running into with the app made me
realize -- I had gone from one service that held the keys to the information
I wanted, into to the hands of another.</p>
<p>This realization forced me to work a little harder on a side project:
<a href="https://github.com/zombified/slicerss">slicerss</a>, which has since been pretty much abandoned. This project let me
really customize how I wanted to read my rss feeds. I setup a very minimal
UI, and it had all the (minimal) features I needed out of it. But, it was
slow... and bound to my home server.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I discovered the key to what I want: I don&#39;t want to even <em>check</em>
another service, and most of the time I just want to view the original article
anyway. I don&#39;t want to share (most of the time) or organize my feeds.</p>
<p>I just want a river of news that makes it easy to mark or save an article and
a link to the original.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rss2email">rss2email</a> - a project which has been in development since at least
2006 (that&#39;s the date of v2.56 in the changelog). What does it do? Very
simply, it downloads a set of RSS feeds, keeps track of which ones it has
sent you, and emails the ones it hasn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Super, super, simple. Zero dependence on 3rd party services or proprietary
software, an active project, and minimal system requirements. Plus, it&#39;s
available anywhere I can access my email! I can use my email system to
flag/pin/star or save any particular articles I want to, and I can just delete
the rest.</p>
<p>Why I didn&#39;t do this sooner? Beats me. Now I just have a cron job that runs
<code>r2e run</code> once a day, and then, when I want to, I can just check my email.</p>
