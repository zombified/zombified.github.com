      <description>Experiments with haXe</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm interested in playing around with <a href="http://haxe.org">haXe</a> -- it seems like a concept I could get behind and have some fun with.</p>
<p>In trying to get a working little example that uses webgl/canvas, I've come accross a file called "Html5Dom.hx".</p>
<p>I was curious about the origin of this file, so I did a small amount of looking. The source seems to be from the <a href="https://launchpad.net/jeash">Jeash</a> project, which was created from the merging of the Canvas-NME and Neash projects. However, the Html5Dom.hx file seems to not contain any reference to webgl until changeset 27 (a0f27fc5c734) on August 16th 2010. At this point a port of the Khronos groups <a href="http://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/webgl.idl">WebGL IDL</a> was added to the file. Further changes fixed areas of the initial port by adding support for the TypedArray ID from the Khronos group.</p>
<p>Easy enough information to find out, but is the file relevant (the webgl spec is moving fast, or so I've read), or is there some other work out there to create an extern library for haxe that enables the use of WebGL for the javascript target?</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this is the best, and possibly only, extern library made publicly available for WebGL use in haXe. I found a <a href="http://mikecann.co.uk/programming/5000000-chrome-crawlers-why-not-haxe-webgl/">blog post</a> by a 'Michael Cann' that uses a version of the Html5Dom.hx extern library for a test project that produces 5,000,000 point sprites on screen, so I think the library is still relevant.</p>
<p>I did find the <a href="https://github.com/tong/hx.html5">hx.html5</a> project, but that seems to just contain extern's for the 2D canvas context.</p>
<p>I also found a extern library for <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">three.js</a>, called <a href="https://github.com/jgranick/three.js-completion">three.js-completion</a>. This library doesn't seem to be updated to the latest three.js version though. Might still be a starting point.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Debugging WebGL</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In experimenting with webgl, I've found the webgl-debug.js script (from the khronos group) extremely helpful.</p>
<p>You can find it, and directions for using it, at: <a href="http://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Debugging">www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Debugging</a></p>
<p>You can also find a link to the WebGL Inspector there as well, which seems like it might be a really useful tool, but with my small experiments thus far, I haven't had the chance to make use of it.</p>
<p>I also found this nice little utility from mrdoob: <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js">stats.js</a> -- it provides FPS and Milliseconds-Per-Frame numbers (along with little charts) and can provide a memory size statistic too, but for that you need to pass special parameters into chrome/safari (at least at the time of this writing).</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>More experimentation</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've been doing a bit of experimentation with languages!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Clojure</em> was interesting, I haven't done much with lisp before, so this was someone of an experience! I definitely enjoyed the absolute simplicity of the syntax and the idea that your code is just data. Fascinating stuff.</li>
<li><em>Scala</em> was different... OO + Functional programming melded together to provide a language with a lot of syntax, but the power to be concise and as fast as any java application.</li>
<li><em>F#</em> -- this one I'm just starting with. It's another OO + Functional language, apparently in the vein of OCaml (which I have zero experience with). So far, I'm rather liking it -- I may even stick with it for long enough to create something substantial with it!</li>

      <description>Fighting with my system and myself</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by (Manic Digger)[http://manicdigger.sourceforge.net/news/], I decided to do some Mono experimentation.</p>
<p>For my experiments, I decided to use OpenTK -- the same as used in ManicDigger.</p>
<p>I am using monodevelop, but I did not realize it doesn't behave like VS in it's build actions -- it does not copy the assemblies required by your application into it's target directory. So I was getting "The entry point method could not be loaded" error messages, but I could not see the rest of the very helpful message, an issue with the setup I was using. I'm not sure if the message was just being clipped, or what.</p>
<p>After a lot of reconfiguring, poking, and googling, my dumb self finally switched to a different setup and saw the rest of the error message:</p>
<pre><code>** (&lt;project directory&gt;/bin/Debug/bd2cs.exe:7982): WARNING **: The following assembly referenced from &lt;project directory&gt;/bin/Debug/bd2cs.exe could not be loaded:
     Assembly:   OpenTK    (assemblyref_index=0)
     Version:    1.0.0.0
     Public Key: bad199fe84eb3df4
The assembly was not found in the Global Assembly Cache, a path listed in the MONO_PATH environment variable, or in the location of the executing assembly (&lt;project directory&gt;/bin/Debug/).

** (&lt;project directory&gt;/bin/Debug/bd2cs.exe:7982): WARNING **: Could not load file or assembly 'OpenTK, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=bad199fe84eb3df4' or one of its dependencies.
The entry point method could not be loaded
</code></pre>
<p>The mono runtime can't find the OpenTK.dll assembly. Simple enough -- just setup a command to execute after the project is built to copy the OpenTK.dll file into the target directory!</p>]]></content:encoded>
