    <content type="html" xml:base="http://zombified.github.com/blog/2011/08/02/fighting-with-my-system-and-myself"><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by (Manic Digger)[http://manicdigger.sourceforge.net/news/], I decided to do some Mono experimentation.</p>
<p>For my experiments, I decided to use OpenTK -- the same as used in ManicDigger.</p>
<p>I am using monodevelop, but I did not realize it doesn't behave like VS in it's build actions -- it does not copy the assemblies required by your application into it's target directory. So I was getting "The entry point method could not be loaded" error messages, but I could not see the rest of the very helpful message, an issue with the setup I was using. I'm not sure if the message was just being clipped, or what.</p>
<p>After a lot of reconfiguring, poking, and googling, my dumb self finally switched to a different setup and saw the rest of the error message:</p>
<pre><code>** (&lt;project directory&gt;/bin/Debug/bd2cs.exe:7982): WARNING **: The following assembly referenced from &lt;project directory&gt;/bin/Debug/bd2cs.exe could not be loaded:
     Assembly:   OpenTK    (assemblyref_index=0)
     Version:    1.0.0.0
     Public Key: bad199fe84eb3df4
The assembly was not found in the Global Assembly Cache, a path listed in the MONO_PATH environment variable, or in the location of the executing assembly (&lt;project directory&gt;/bin/Debug/).

** (&lt;project directory&gt;/bin/Debug/bd2cs.exe:7982): WARNING **: Could not load file or assembly 'OpenTK, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=bad199fe84eb3df4' or one of its dependencies.
The entry point method could not be loaded
</code></pre>
<p>The mono runtime can't find the OpenTK.dll assembly. Simple enough -- just setup a command to execute after the project is built to copy the OpenTK.dll file into the target directory!</p>]]></content>
