    <content type="html" xml:base="http://zombified.github.com/blog/2012/04/26/i'm-not-dead-yet!"><![CDATA[<p>The last several months have been quite eventful for me, and this poor excuse for a blog has been low on my list of priorities -- but no longer!. Well, maybe it's moved up a notch or two.</p>
<p>I will probably continue my declare 'MelonJS' articles soon, but for now I am on to other things.</p>
<p>First up is my <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&amp;uid=7263">ludum dare #23 entry</a>, a text adventure called 'The Tiny World'. It's not fancy, and it's built from scratch (I know, I know -- I probably should have just gone with inform7). Play it if you like, it's probably mediocre at best!</p>
<p>Second up, my new job is a lot about Python and, more specifically, Plone, so expect to see some posts on those things.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="http://zombified.github.com/blog/2012/02/24/updates"><![CDATA[<p>I Decided to sit down and design a new theme, which is still rough and in development. </p>
<p>I also decided it was time to move my website over to github. This is for a couple of reasons... so I don't have all my eggs in one basket (Google), and so I don't have to do as much maintenance.</p>
<p>Basically the appengine tools are tools that I only use for updating my website/blog. Why not replace those tools with a single tool that I use for other stuff to?</p>
<p>Now I just need to use git, which I don't have to manually update and setup since it's in my OS's package repositories! Woohoo, less work for me!</p>]]></content>
