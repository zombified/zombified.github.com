      <description>Updates</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I Decided to sit down and design a new theme, which is still rough and in development. </p>
<p>I also decided it was time to move my website over to github. This is for a couple of reasons... so I don't have all my eggs in one basket (Google), and so I don't have to do as much maintenance.</p>
<p>Basically the appengine tools are tools that I only use for updating my website/blog. Why not replace those tools with a single tool that I use for other stuff to?</p>
<p>Now I just need to use git, which I don't have to manually update and setup since it's in my OS's package repositories! Woohoo, less work for me!</p>]]></content:encoded>
